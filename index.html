      <p>Hi! My name is Nathan Shankar, but I've been called J.J. ever since I was born (a nickname from my mom).</p>
      <p>I study math and economics at Pomona College. I'm interested in mathematical modeling, politics, and film.</p>
      <p>I plan to use this website as a simple repository for notes and thoughts. Making it publicly accessible will hopefully provide incentive for me to make my thoughts more coherent.</p>
