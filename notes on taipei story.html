      <h2>Notes on Taipei Story</h2>
      <p>Edward Yang, the late Taiwanese director, is best known for <em>A Brighter Summer Day</em> (1991) and <em>Yi Yi</em> (2000). Each sprawling, multi-faceted films that run in excess of three hours, these tend to overshadow some of Yang's other work, including 1985's <em>Taipei Story</em>. While <em>Taipei Story</em> has a solid reputation of its own, as one of the first works of New Taiwanese Cinema to receive international attention, but it seems to sit a tier below Yang's subsequent twin masterworks in the minds of many. Or at least, perhaps it isn't as widely viewed (although one hopes that would change, given that it's available on Criterion Channel now!). Either way, consider this a much deserved <em>Taipei Story</em> appreciation post.</p>
      <p>Yang's sophomore effort centers on a couple living in the titular city. Chin, a young sunglass-sporting woman with a lush mane of curly black hair, works as an assistant at an architecture firm. She is fiercely devoted to Lung (played by Yang's friend, and fellow giant of Taiwanese cinema Hou Hsiao-hsien), a well-built, middle-aged man who has just returned from the states, and may or may not have stopped over at Tokyo on the way back to visit a mistress. Lung takes pride in his youth baseball playing days -- he seems to be best known for this among the friends and acquaintances among his generation, which include a local bartender and his aging former baseball coach Mr. Lai. Newly reunited at film's start, Chin and Lung make plans to soon get married, and perhaps afterwards head back to the United States to assist Lung's brother-in-law with his prosperous import-export company.</p>  
      <p>It quickly becomes clear, however, that the situation is not so rosy for the couple. The architecture firm that Chin works at faces lawsuits for an accident at one of its buildings, and has been bought up by another firm, which means restructuring. Chin's erstwhile boss, the caring Ms. Mei, has left the company. Chin chooses to follow Ms. Mei out rather than face demotion. Meanwhile, Lung's fabric trading business is floundering. Additionally, after so much time apart, something has clearly altered in Chin and Lung's relationship, in no small part due to Lung's suspicious behavior in having a mistress. A strange distance has opened between them, a distance that gradually grows as the movie progresses.</p>
      <p>The Taipei of <em>Taipei Story</em> film is aggressively evolving, aggressively globalizing. Yang's cinematography, in depicting the wide-open spaces, sharp angles, and colorful yet oppressive geometries of the modernized city, recalls that of Tati's <em>Playtime</em>. Taipei is a city where it's increasingly difficult for one to assert their identity or find their place. Towards the beginning, Chin's co-worker, the architect Mr. Ke, encapsulates this sentiment when he remarks of Taipei's buildings, "They all look the same. Whether I'm involved or not seems less and less important." No amount of technology, sleek appliances, neon billboards, or the supposed close physical proximity among urban dwellers can mask the elusiveness of genuine human connection. This is an idea Yang would revisit in <em>Yi Yi</em>, and one that would form the thematic backbone of fellow Taiwanese auteur Tsai Ming-liang's craft.</p>
      <p>Urban listlessness and loneliness is underscored by wide shots of empty buildings and near-empty streets. Yang's characters, often shown in contemplation, always seem to have a million different things on their minds. They suffer beneath the weight of their own existences. They all seem to be going through the motions -- life has clearly not delivered on its promises to them. Yet they are continually led on by opportunities to start anew, filled with an odd yet unmistakably human belief that the loneliness and emptiness in their lives must give way to something better. Chin admits so much herself at the beginning when she says "I don't like being so pessimistic. Looking at things that way makes me sad." In this way, vacancy at times comes to signify new beginnings and infinite possibilities. Consider the shots of vacant interiors that bookend <em>Taipei Story</em>. Both carry a sense of optimism. In that opening scene, as Chin and Lung tour an unfurnished apartment unit, we see Chin espouse her vision about the life that she and her boyfriend will share in their new dwelling. In the final scene, Chin blankly stares out the window as Ms. Mei enthusiastically discusses the floorplan for her new office space.</p>
      <p>Such hopes turn out to be misguided. What makes <em>Taipei Story</em> such a devastating watch is that one by one, we see the hopes of the central characters snapped. In the Darwin-esque landscape of Yang's film, those who fail to adapt get left behind, and it becomes apparent that Lung and Chin have failed to adapt.</p>
