      <p><b>Day 1.</b> I arrived in Taipei very early in the morning. I was very tired after a long flight. Part of me felt anxious about whether Taiwan would still feel the same after my splendid adventures there last time. After rebounding at a coffee shop, I took some long walks through the city, visiting old favorites like Kuo's Astral Bookstore on Dihua Street, Loma Restaurant (my favorite breakfast place in Hualien, since relocated to Taipei, I was so happy when the owner still remembered me), and the big Eslite bookstore by Zhongshan metro station. I also saw some new places in Datong District, like the Taipei Confucius Temple. </p>

      <p><b>Day 2.</b> I followed an itinerary that my former Hualien roommate Alyssa had once shared with me. I took the red line to Tamsui and rented a scooter there. On the train I felt nervous that I would not be able to ride a scooter after many months in America. But magically, once I rolled out of the shop, it felt like just like old times. I rode along the Northern Coast of Taiwan, stopping at scenic areas like Baisha Bay, Fugui Cape (the northernmost point of Taiwan), the Shimen Arch, and the famous Yehliu Geopark. The weather was gray and rainy but it felt great to be back in the saddle again. Along the way I stopped at a relaxing cafe overlooking the coast. After touring the curious rocks at Yehliu Geopark, I cut back across to Tamsui via Yangmingshan National Park. There was a large rainstorm in the mountains, and I felt fortunate to make it back safely. I ended the day by eating dinner at a delicious noodle shop in the Ximen shopping district.</p>

      <p><b>Day 3.</b> The previous day had really been a bit too intense. So I resolved to take things slower. In the morning, I did my laundry and got a haircut at an old-style men's barbershop next to my hotel. The auntie there was incredibly thorough, she cut my hair very precisely, gave me a thorough wash, dry, and shave, and even gave me some hot water to drink. It was one of the finest haircuts I have ever had, and I felt great afterwards.</p>
