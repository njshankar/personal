      <p><b>Day 1.</b> I arrived in Taipei very early in the morning. I was very tired after a long flight. Part of me felt anxious about whether Taiwan would still feel the same after my splendid adventures there last time. After rebounding at a coffee shop, I took some long walks through the city, visiting old favorites like Kuo's Astral Bookstore on Dihua Street, Loma Restaurant (my favorite breakfast place in Hualien, since relocated to Taipei, I was so happy when the owner still remembered me), and the big Eslite bookstore by Zhongshan metro station. I also saw some new places in Datong District, like the Taipei Confucius Temple. </p>
