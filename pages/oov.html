      <p>And now it's officially over. The date is June 30th, the time is 8:47pm. I am an ex-teacher. An ex-Fulbright <em>scholar</em>. How humbling it is to be stripped off not only my unquestioned authority over hundreds of young children, but also my status as a lover of knowledge, a student of the world. Oof. Feels bad man. Time to go back to being an ordinary civilian. It was fun while it lasted. </p>
      <p>It wasn't just merely fun. It was really fun. A little bit <em>too</em>fun, perhaps.</p>
      <p>Saying goodbye to the third graders yesterday was not as fun. It was sad. They are so cute and curious. I came to care and know about each and every one of them. To become wildly obsessive over their succcess. But it was also happy. They have improved so much (especially on the last exam!). And the letters and small gifts that some of them gave me? That was fun. But also sad. Sadness can be fun sometimes, I guess.</p>
      <p>Today was fun and sad, but in a more low-key way. The morning was very clear. I rode towards the mountains in their deep green greatness. I saw my students eating breakfast at the corner cafe. Hi Wendy! Hi Tina! And parked my scooter by the pre-school. There was a closing ceremony. I got to see my all-star students strut on stage one last time for a series of happy photo-ops. And then they talked about summer safety. Don't race each other on bicycles! Don't wear jeans while swimming!</p>
      <p>And then they gave a ceremony for Teacher Su Qiong, who is retiring after 25 years. She is the lifeblood of the school. No exaggeration. The school would not run without her. And she has always been very kind to me also. The students all ran up to her for a group hug. And the PE teacher played a tribute to her on his recorder.</p>
      <p>And then it was time to hunker (down) in the bunker. To organize the English classroom. Desks to straighten. Papers to recycle. Chalkboards to erase. Windows to shutter. Third grade remedial exams to grade (more of them passed this time!). The quiet fifth grader O'eConner asked me to sign his notebook. The cheery third grader Jim asked me for a hug. The 5A NBA stans came in briefly to pick up my namecard. I ran into the third grader Dinosaur in the hallway briefly. But other than these, mostly a student-free day. They must all be very happy for their summer break!</p>
      <p>The bell struck 12:30, marking the end. I sauntered down to the teachers' office to drop off small presents for Teacher Su Qiong and Director Cai Ling. I encountered a few third graders who made me promise I wouldn't forget them. How could I? I went back to the English classroom to fetch my bag, and to hit the lights. I saw my piano scores on the counter. In another world, I would have gone to the music room to play the piano one last time. But I felt that it would do no good to linger much longer. I started for the school gate, pausing briefly to admire the greenery, and the distant figures of students heading for home. Then I fired on my scooter, and rode off into a new level of life. </p>
