      <p>At first, I thought it was just a quick little roadside stop before entering the very, very long tunnel that goes north to Yilan. But actually, there's an entire highway that runs along the edge of the cliffs. Riding on a sunny day, the ocean appears sparkling white and doesn't seem real. The road is almost empty, so I could stop anytime I liked. There are also many anonmymous waterfalls from mountain streams that plunge down the cliffs into the sea. </p>
