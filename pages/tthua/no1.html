      <p>I promise, I'm not just being politically correct - the school is so beautiful! The campus is situated next to the mountains, and has many gardens, trees, and playing fields. It has the largest swimming pool in all of Hualien. From the third floor, you can see all the way to Mount Meilun, almost to the sea. And the students, full of curiosity and playful spirit, made the halls come to life each day during my time in Hualien, bringing me an indescribable amount of joy. </p>
