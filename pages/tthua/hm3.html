      <p>For me, this place sometimes represented the beginning of a new adventure. But never before admiring the place I was leaving behind. The view of the city from the departures hall on the second floor is breahtaking! Other times, this place represented returning home. Walking through the underpass, bleary-eyed yet inspired by the beautiful pictures of Hualien's treasures on each side. I've been to each one now. </p>
