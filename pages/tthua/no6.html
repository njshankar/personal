      <p>It's a little bit remote, and I had to pay $300 to enter. But the forest was very peaceful, with many butterflies flittering about in March (it's no wonder that they also call it "Butterfly Valley"). The trail runs along the edge of a river filled with white boulders. At the end, there's a waterfall and a very high suspension bridge. After my hike, I had a nice stroll through the sculpture garden and bathed in the hot springs. </p>
