      <p>Riding on Highway 8 to the Hehuanshan was the peak (literally, and figuratively) of my travels around Taiwan. The mountains are craggly and covered in patchy golden grasses, having the appearance of an illustration in a Dr. Seuss book. The hikes are embarrassingly easy compared to the views offered at the top, where you can see the sea of clouds, rocky Mount Qilai, and the tea villages of Dayuling. </p>
