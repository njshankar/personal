      <h2>Honorable Mention - Liyu Lake (鯉魚潭)</h2>

      <p>It's really more like a large pond. But it's a very peaceful one. I have passed pleasant hours taking in the calm waters, mountain scenery, cute cafes, boat rental shops, fairgrounds, and forests. There are also monkeys and fireflies (in May). </p>
      <h2>Honorable Mention - Beibin (北濱) and Nanbin （南濱）</h2>
      <div class = "imagebox">

      </div>
      <p>They're different, but both fun. Beibin has the rocky river mouth, and the nice walking path that follows an old railway line. Nanbin has the playgrounds, full of children on weekend afternoons. The lantern festival was also held there. </p>
      <h2>Honorable Mention - Hualien Train Station （花蓮火車站）</h2>

      <p>For me, this place sometimes represented the beginning of a new adventure. But never before admiring the city I was leaving behind. The view of the mountains from the departures hall on the second floor is breahtaking! Other times, this place represented returning home. Walking through the underpass, bleary-eyed yet inspired by the beautiful pictures of Hualien's treasures on each side. I've been to each one now. </p>
      <h2>10 - Qixingtan （七星潭）</h2>
      <div class = "imagebox">
        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/qxt.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>It was one of the very first places I visited in Hualien. For many months, though, I neglected it and never came back. Only in spring did I re-discover the peace of the vast sandy crescent, browsing the bicycle paths that lead up to the cliffs overlooking the waters, and, head hunched over, squeezing through the old military tunnels that run underneath them. </p>
