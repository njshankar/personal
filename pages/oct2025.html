      <p>I recently solo travelled to the Jiangnan region in China. I covered lots of ground on this one, visiting six World Heritage Sites in 14 days. My agendas each day were full, with an average of 25,000 steps, but two weeks definitely did not feel like enough. That being said, I was able to step away from the office for a bit (thanks to my kindly managers), and at least get a small sampling of what must be one of the most culturally and historically rich regions of the world.</p>
      <h3>Shanghai</h3>
      <p>My first stop was Shanghai. Similar to Hong Kong, growing up, I had passed through the airport a couple of times when travelling with my mom and brother to Macau, but had regrettably never actually seen the city. Well this time, I finally got to have my fill.</p>

      <p>My hotel was located along the wonderful Huanghe Road. Walking on the side of the road past the rush of pedestrians and bicyclists, enjoying the smells of the food stalls and bubble tea shops, you feel like you are transported back to the 1920s.</p>
