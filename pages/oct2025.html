      <p>I recently solo travelled to the Jiangnan region in China. I covered lots of ground on this one, visiting six World Heritage Sites in 14 days. My agendas each day were full, with an average of 25,000 steps, but two weeks definitely did not feel like enough. That being said, I was able to step away from the office for a bit (thanks to my kindly managers), and at least get a small sampling of what must be one of the most culturally and historically rich regions of the world.</p>
