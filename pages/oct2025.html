      <p>I recently travelled solo to the Jiangnan region in China. I covered lots of ground on this one, visiting six World Heritage Sites in 14 days. My agendas each day were full, with an average of 25,000 steps, but two weeks definitely did not feel like enough. At least though, I was able to get a small sampling of what must be one of the most incredible regions in the world.</p>
      <h3>Shanghai</h3>

      <p>Shanghai Maglev train. Even though they nerfed the speed a few years back, riding was still fun.</p>

      <p>My hotel was located along Huanghe Road. Walking on the side of the road past the rush of pedestrians and bicyclists, enjoying the smells of the food stalls and bubble tea shops, I felt transported back to an earlier time.</p>

      <p>Is The Bund more magnificent in the daytime or nighttime? It's hard for me to decide.</p>

      <p>During a morning walk in People's Park, I saw elderly matchmakers, people doing traditional exercises, a man sword dancing. Literally felt like something out of my first-year college Chinese textbook.</p>

      <p>Yu Garden, the first of many many gardens that I visited during my travels.</p>

      <p>My favorite part of Shanghai was walking around. There are many pleasant streets in the city, thoroughly shaded by canopies of expansive plane trees, and lined by old-style alley residences, many of which have been converted into warm cafes, teahouses, boutiques, bookstores, and even violin shops. Many of the older buildings will be marked with a sign affording little details about the date of completion, architectural style, and materials used, which makes the city feel like a living museum. And in districts like Xintiandi, historic structures sit side-by-side with modern skyscrapers and shopping centers. The urban texture of the city is finely layered, with so many fun places to browse and linger. I think it would be a wonderful city to live in.</p>
