      <p>I recently travelled solo to the Jiangnan region in China. I covered lots of ground on this one, visiting six World Heritage Sites in 14 days. My agendas each day were full, with an average of 25,000 steps, but two weeks definitely did not feel like enough. At very least though, I was able to step away from the office for a bit (thanks to my kindly managers), and get a small sampling of what must be one of the most culturally and historically rich regions of the world.</p>
      <h3>Shanghai</h3>
      <p>My first stop was Shanghai. Similar to Hong Kong, growing up, I had passed through the airport a couple of times when travelling with my mom and brother to Macau, but had regrettably never actually seen the city. This time, I finally got to have my fill. The very first thing I did was to take the maglev train from the airport. Even though they apparently nerfed the speed a few years back, I was impressed by how smooth the ride was, and as for gliding past all of the cars on the adjacent freeway, that was quite fun.</p>

      <p>My hotel was located along the wonderful Huanghe Road. Walking on the side of the road past the rush of pedestrians and bicyclists, enjoying the smells of the food stalls and bubble tea shops, you feel like you are transported back to the 1920s. Each day, I ate at a delicious breakfast of fried rice, tea eggs, and soy milk for only $1.50. On my last day there, I dined at the Gong De Lin vegetarian restaurant for lunch and stood in line to buy the famous butterfly palmiers from the Park Hotel Deli.</p>

      <p>During my stay in Shanghai, I visited The Bund three times, twice during the night, when there is an unending tide of pedestrians, and once during the morning, when the promenade is mostly emptied out, save for a few joggers. Lingering in such a pleasant space, with the elegant 1920s-style buildings on one side, and the breathtaking skyline of the Lujiazui financial district on the other side, was an incredibile feeling.</p>

      <p>I also visited several other famous attractions like Yu Garden, Jingan Temple, Wukang Mansions, and the Xujiahui Shopping Complex.</p>

      <p>Ultimately though, my favorite part of Shanghai was simply walking around. There are many pleasant streets in the city, thoroughly shaded by canopies of expansive plane trees, and lined by old-style alley residences, many of which have been converted into warm cafes, teahouses, boutiques, bookstores, and even violin shops. Many of the older buildings will be marked with a sign affording little details about the date of completion, architectural style, and materials used, which makes the city feel like a living museum. And in districts like Xintiandi, historic structures sit side-by-side with ultra-modern skyscrapers and shopping centers. The urban texture of the city is finely layered, with so many fun places to browse and just exist in. I think it would be a wonderful city to live in, and found myself feeling somewhat envious of the residents during my travels.</p>
