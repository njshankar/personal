      <p><em>Milennium Mambo</em> (2001) so gracefully embraces the contraditions of youth, capturing not only the euphoria, but the listlessness, the quiet sorrows that come with it. The film's opening scene is one of only two scenes I can say to have truly left me floored (I hope to write about the other one in a later post). Here, I hope to be able to briefly elaborate on why.</p>
      <p>Hou Hsiao-hsien is one of my cinematic heroes. His films are humanistic, using small stories -- character sketches, really --  of everyday people as a vechicle for exploring how we journey across time and history. The tales he tells in many of his films -- of loss and adolescence (<em>The Time to Live, the Time to Die</em>), of gritty urban life (<em>Dust in the Wind</em>), of aimless drifters (<em>Goodbye South, Goodbye</em>), of prostitutes (<em>Flowers of Shanghai</em>) -- are rather simple and unassuming, with small casts of characters. They are embellished by Hou's meticulous shot compositions, as well as the lyrical, heartfelt dialogue penned by Hou and frequent collaborator Chu T'ien-wen, one of the most acclaimed writers in all of Taiwan. The rather slow-developing, unassuming nature of Hou's films belies his stylistic boldness. Consider the static cinematography and deep depth of field in <em>The Puppetmaster</em> (1993), that mimicks the staging of the puppet shows the central character performs, or the floating camera that glides through the decadent brothels of Shanghai in <em>Flowers of Shanghai</em> (1998). What I love about HHH is that his works are abstract yet deeply rooted in the flow of life, with stylistic experimentation that doesn't draw attention to itself.</p>
      <p>This brings me back to <em>Milennium Mambo</em>, which follows a young woman named Vicky and her relationships with two men, set against the backdrop of Taipei's nightclub scene. In the prime of her youth, drawn into a relationship with her manipulative boyfriend Hao-Hao, Vicky lives out a life of constant partying, sex, and liberal drug use. For better or for worse, her hard-charging lifestyle is a way of escape from the general sense of aimlessness and boredom that pervades her life. The entire film is a symphony of textures and color -- of blues, reds, yellows -- that puts even Wong Kar-wai to shame, accompanied by angsty, restless camerawork and an ever-present soundtrack of high-octane club music. Needless to say, <em>Milennium Mambo</em> bucks the trend of understatement from HHH's earlier filmography.</p>
      <p>The opening scene is an emphatic signal of this departure, which is perhaps one reason it had such a profound effect on me.</p>
        
          
      <p>The opening credits flash against a pitch black background. A slight hissing noise grows progressively louder, into a vigorous pulse. The director's name flashes onscreen, and we find ourselves staring upwards at a strip of ceiling lights which stretch far into the distance like a set of train tracks. From the look of it, the setting is some sort of tunnel, one that gently curves off to the right. The camera moves fluidly forwards, lowers slightly, and reveals the back of a young woman, walking on an overpass. She struts forward in a self-assured manner. Her lush black hair sways to the rhythm of her steps. Periodically, she takes a breezy draw from her cigarette, or turns her head to the side. The woman's broad, easy movements have a fluidity that matches those of the camera that tracks them. An ethereal echo and a few piano notes now accompany the insect-like pulsing.</p> 

      <p>The moment depicted in the scene is clearly a happy one. Vicky's carefree walk </p>
