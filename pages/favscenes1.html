      <p>The opening credits flash against a pitch black background. A slight hissing noise grows progressively louder, into a vigorous pulse. The director's name flashes onscreen, and we find ourselves staring upwards at a strip of ceiling lights which stretch far into the distance like a set of train tracks. From the look of it, the setting is some sort of tunnel, one that gently curves off to the right. The camera moves fluidly forwards, lowers slightly, and reveals the back of a young woman, walking on an overpass. She struts forward in a self-assured manner. Her broad, easy movements have a fluidity that matches those of the camera that tracks them. An ethereal echo and a few piano notes now accompany the insect-like pulsing.</p> 
      <p><em>Milennium Mambo</em> is one of my favorite films from one of my very favorite directors, Hou Hsiao-hsien. It so perfectly embraces the contradictions of youth, capturing not only the euphoria, but the listlessness, the quiet sorrows that come with it. And the film's opening scene is one of only two scenes I can say to have truly left me floored (the second is the post-credit scene from Claire Denis's <em>Beau Travail</em>, which I hope to write about in a later post). Here, I hope to be able to briefly elaborate on why.</p>
      <p>The moment depicted in the scene is clearly a happy one. </p>
