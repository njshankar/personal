      <p> No team in the NFL is better at playing dull and uninspired football than the Chicago Bears. I was a pretty passionate fan when I was younger; but after ten plus years of misery, I was well on my way out. Then came Justin Fields. The first part of this season was pretty rough, but I can now see him starting to make more good throws, take less sacks, and play cleaner football, all while doing the magic with his legs that he's always been known for. The O-line is leagues better than they were at the beginning of the season. The defense is playing with swagger (give Coach Eberflus credit where it's due). The defense line is getting to the quarterback at a borderline-acceptable clip now since the addition of Montez. The secondary is grabbing takeaways like it's 2010. We've got some good, hungry young players back there. Jacquan Brisker. Tyrique Stevenson. Jaylon Johnson. For the first time in a while, I can say that I'm genuinely excited about the Chicago Bears.</p>
