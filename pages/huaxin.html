      <p> This fall, I've been steadily working my way through Luo's <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> (the Moss Roberts translation). There's this passage in Book II that concerns Hua Xin, 華歆, the imperial secretary under prime minister Cao Cao. Empress Wu, resentful over how the domineering prime minister has essentially taken the royal family hostage, write to her father to plot against him. However, Cao Cao intercepts the eunuch bearing the Empress's letter, and after finding out about the scheme, charges Hua Xin with seizing her from the palace. Luo describes the secretary as follows: </p>
      <p style = "color: skyblue">  Hua Xin, known as a talented man, was a close friend of Bing Yuan and of Guan Ning. At the time the trio was called "The Dragon"; Hua Xin was the head, Bing Yuan the stomach, and Guan Ning the tail. One day Guan Ning and Hua Xin turned up a piece of gold while planting some garden vegetables. Guan Ning continued working, but Hua Xin picked it up, examined it, and threw it down again. Another day, Guan Ning and Hua Xin were reading together, when they heard a commotion outside as a man of importance passed by their gate in his carriage. Guan Ning remained seated and did not stir, but Hua Xin put down his book to look. From then on, Guan Ning held a low opinion of Hua Xin and eventually ended the friendship. In later years Guan Ning secluded himself in a storied building in remote Liaodong. He always wore a white cap; and he lived and slept upstairs, never letting his feet touch the ground, thereby demonstrating that he had never served the kingdom of Wei. Hua Xin, however, entered Cao Cao's service after leaving Sun Quan. Such was his story up to the day he arrested the Empress.</p>
