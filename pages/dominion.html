      <p>I’m baffled that so many people believe the Dominion base game to be boring. Granted, I haven’t played any of the expansions, so I don’t know how much better they are in comparison. But the Dominion base is an exhilarating and highly-complex game in its own right. I mean, in theory, there are 26 choose 10 possible games that come with the base set, which is somewhere over five million. Mastering it may very well take several years, if not a lifetime. </p>
      <p>I was introduced to Dominion by a professor of mine over the summer, and I’m embarrassed to say how many hours I’ve put into it. While my win rate is still quite disappointing, I’ll list some notes from my experience here, mostly aimed at myself. </p>
      <div style = "text-align: left;">
        <p style = "color: Gray;"><b>CELLAR</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pretty strong card. Good for sustaining rallies, particularly if the hand contains some Gardens, Curses, Coppers, Estates, and/or Provinces. </li>
          <li>If you discard the non-money/non-action cards and come up with a non-terminal card on the redraw, you’re golden. However, the price is that a hand with a cellar is effectively reduced to four cards.</li>
          <li>I think it’s good to buy a few of these, but more than two or three.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: Gray;"><b>CHAPEL</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Becomes pretty useless after the first few rounds, but invaluable in the early game.</li>
          <li>Don’t pass up the opportunity to trash weak cards when a Chapel appears in your hand. It will be tempting if you, say, have a hand with a Chapel/3 Coppers/1 Estate to just trash the estate and use the remaining coppers to buy a Silver. But just think: as the game goes on – and you buy more good cards – you’ll have fewer and fewer opportunities to trash so many weak cards in one shot. Trash those coppers!</li>
          <li>Don’t overtrash, though. There have been a few embarrassing instances where I trashed all of my coppers without buying enough Silver to compensate, leaving me in the awkward position of having to use a turn to buy a copper. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: RoyalBlue;"><b>MOAT</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spamming moats seems to be an effective strategy if one has several Villages and/or Festivals. It’s pretty much a poor-man’s Smithy. </li>
          <li>Of course, it’s always good to buy a couple of them in a game with many attack cards (like Bandit or Witch). It’s really annoying to play an attack card and have your opponent whip out a Moat. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: GreenYellow;"><b>HARBINGER</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A pretty boring card. It’s a lame Merchant. </li>
          <li>Seems to only be good if you have an attack card that you’d like to play as often as possible, like a Witch. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: GreenYellow;"><b>MERCHANT</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>One of my favorite cards. Buying a silver and then spamming some Merchants has won me a good many games. </li>
          <li>Just think: if you have one silver and all ten Merchants, then that silver is worth $12. Throw some Markets/Festivals into the mix, and that’s one or more two-Province turns. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: Red;"><b>VASSAL</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Another one of my favorites. </li>
          <li>It’s quasi-terminal, and can be absolutely deadly in large numbers with a few deck-control cards like Sentry, or a few double action cards like Throne Room or Festival that essentially gives you $4 as well as two cracks at triggering an additional action card. </li>
          <li>A strategy with lots of Vassals will probably mostly forgo treasure cards. It’s probably only worth it if there are action-giving buy cards like Festival or Market in the mix. That way, you won’t be stuck being able to buy 1 Province per turn – with a well-executed strategy, a 2 or even 3 Province turn is possible. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;">
        <p style = "color: Gold;"><b>VILLAGE</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A bread-and-butter type of card. Good for kingdoms heavy on non-terminal action cards (i.e. Remodel or Smithy or Mine), and an extra draw always helps!</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: SaddleBrown;"><b>WORKSHOP</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not a bad card to have in combination with a +2 action card like Village or Festival. In this case it’s pretty much an extra good buy.</li>
          <li>Of course, there’s also the “Gardens Rush” strategy, which I am fond of: spamming the workshops and then cleaning up the Gardens and Estates. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;">
        <p style = "color: Gray;"><b>BUREAUCRAT</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>I like the idea of frustrating your opponent with Red Tape, but it’s non-terminal and the attack is pretty much worthless in Chapel games. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;">
        <p style = "color: ForestGreen;"><b>GARDENS</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Good for the aforementioned “Gardens Rush” strategy, also a discount Duchy (or better!) in many situations. </li>
          <li>Therefore, it constitutes a nice pivot strategy. If you’re down by quite a bit in the midgame, stacking up on Gardens can be a good (if somewhat desperate) way to salvage the game and pull out ahead. </li>
          <li>Also an interesting card from a defensive standpoint. If your opponent seems to show signs of a Gardens strategy, is it good to start buying them yourself to shut out their source of points? Or better yet: if your opponent seems to have a powerful hand, is it worth buying a Garden just to bait them into buying some Gardens of their own, thus weakening their deck power?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: Black;"><b>MILITIA</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A pest. Will usually be a great card to buy in the early game, and it’s also annoying in the late game, as it could stop your opponent from getting over $8.</li>
          <li>The drawback is that it’s terminal. Is probably best in kingdoms with Villages/Festivals, but even if not, is worth a buy. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: SaddleBrown;"><b>MONEYLENDER</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A mid-tier card. Good for early game, helping to clean out your deck and to rack up some $5 cards. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;">
        <p style = "color: GreenYellow;"><b>POACHER</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interesting card. Can be good in the early game to get to $5 and in the midgame to sustain rallies. But in the late game it can be an unmitigated disaster, especially if your opponent has the good sense to empty out 1 or 2 piles; in such a case the Poacher is an active hindrance. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: Gray;"><b>REMODEL</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is the card that I fear most in the Dominion base game. </li>
          <li>In the early game, it can serve a similar purpose to Moneylender, but with Estates instead of Provinces. In kingdoms with Villages/Festivals, it can continue to be an effective mechanism for deck improvement. </li>
          <li>The late game is when the Remodel is absolutely fearsome. With a few Remodels and Golds in the deck, as well as a couple Villages or Throne Rooms, 2 or 3 Provinces can be gained in rapid fashion. </li>
          <li>For this reason, Remodel can be potent in combination with Bandit and Village/Throne Room.</li>
          <li>My favorite usage of the Remodel is as follows: if you have a lead over your opponent with only 1 outstanding Province, and you have a Province in your hand, you can remodel the Province for a …. Province. This secures the win. It has to be the most stupid way to end a game of Base Dominion. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: Black;"><b>SMITHY</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>I tend to stay away from it because it’s terminal and not an attack card. </li>
          <li>But it can be very effective in combination with a few Villages, or better yet, a few Festivals. As has been well-documented, it’s a linchpin of a Big Money strategy.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: Red;"><b>THRONE ROOM</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The chameleon of base Dominion. The presence of a Throne Room in the deck greatly enhances the power of any strategy. </li>
          <li>Throne Room seems to have particular synergy with Sentry, Vassal, Merchant, Market, and Remodel (in the late game). </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: Black;"><b>BANDIT</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Another thorn in the opponent’s side. Having hard-earned treasures razed by a Bandit attack will be highly-frustrating for the opponent (unless they too gained these treasures via Bandit).  </li>
          <li>Terminal, so of course it’s better with a Village/Festival type of card.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: SaddleBrown;"><b>COUNCIL ROOM</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The crown jewel of a Big Money strategy. Lord Rattington seems to love it, and for good reason.  </li>
          <li>In a hand heavy with good treasures, the extra four cards (and that extra buy!) allow one to quickly amass lots of great cards, and eventually Provinces.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: Orange;"><b>FESTIVAL</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Terminal, but has many effective synergies with terminal and quasi-terminal cards. </li>
          <li>Those extra $2 and the extra buy are great in the early game as well. If you buy a Festival and hit $6 with it early on, that’s two Merchants/Vassals/Silvers in one turn, which is a major confidence booster.</li>
          <li>Usually the first card I buy once I hit $5. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: Gray;"><b>LABORATORY</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>S-tier card. An ideal lubricant for the deck, with Big-Money-esque benefits to boot.</li>
          <li>With a handful of Laboratories and non-terminal actions in the deck, the entire thing can effectively be cycled through in one turn. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;">
        <p style = "color: SaddleBrown;"><b>LIBRARY</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>I don’t usually buy this card. It’s terminal and only increases deck size marginally in most cases.</li>
          <li>I will concede though that it’s a good antidote to the Militia, and seems to have a strong synergy with the Festival/Village (in which case it serves as a more-selective Moat).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;">
        <p style = "color: Orange;"><b>MARKET</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A solid card. It’s tempting to spam them, but the marginal benefit of those extra buys diminishes quickly and the $1 benefit that comes with each is rather paltry when compared with those that come with the Vassal and Festival. </li>
          <li>That being said, it’s usually worth it to have a couple in the deck if they’re available. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: Gray;"><b>MINE</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Another one of those terminal cards that’s worth buying only if you’re also going to buy some Villages/Festivals/Throne Rooms. </li>
          <li>It’s good for increasing a deck’s monetary power and being able to reap the benefit in-turn, but the opportunity cost is high.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;">
        <p style = "color: SaddleBrown;"><b>SENTRY</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not as high on this card as others seem to be. It has some strong synergies, and can bring about tremendous deck control as well as higher deck efficiency, but otherwise it’s just a fancy Merchant/Harbinger. Not giving any extra buys or cash is a big minus. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: Purple;"><b>WITCH</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The second most fearsome card in base Dominion, after the Remodel. </li>
          <li>It’s usually worth buying early on so you can push as big a portion of the 10 curses as possible into your opponent’s hands. </li>
          <li>Doing so not only diminishes their score, but seriously hinders their ability for deck-building. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <p style = "color: Orange;"><b>ARTISAN</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Another card I don’t have very much experience with. I tend to group it in the same category as the Mine – only good with Throne Room/+2 action cards in the deck. In such a case it can be an effective rally-sustainer, as you can buy a $5 non-terminal card and play it in the same turn (at the cost of discarding another one of the cards in your hand, of course). </li>
          <li>Of course, if there aren’t many $5 cards in the kingdom to begin with, it’s a ridiculously-overpriced Workshop and there’s no reason to buy it. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
