      <p>I’m baffled that so many people believe the Dominion base game to be boring. Granted, I haven’t played any of the expansions, so I don’t know how much better they are in comparison. But the Dominion base is an exhilarating and highly-complex game in its own right. I mean, in theory, there are 26 choose 10 possible games that come with the base set, which is somewhere over five million. Mastering it may very well take several years, if not a lifetime. </p>
      <p>I was introduced to Dominion by a professor of mine over the summer, and I’m embarrassed to say how many hours I’ve put into it. While my win rate is still quite disappointing, I’ll list some notes from my experience here, mostly aimed at myself. </p>
      <p><b>CELLAR</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pretty strong card. Good for sustaining rallies, particularly if the hand contains some Gardens, Curses, Coppers, Estates, and/or Provinces. </li>
        <li>If you discard the non-money/non-action cards and come up with a non-terminal card on the redraw, you’re golden. However, the price is that a hand with a cellar is effectively reduced to four cards.</li>
        <li>I think it’s good to buy a few of these, but more than two or three.</li>
