      <p>A vintage Saturday. Started the day off with Chick fil-A iced coffee in Pasadena. Then drove to Claremont, locally. Mostly along Foothill Boulevard. Some really marvelous little towns along the way. Sierra Madre and Monrovia, which I've been to before. But also Duarte (with its long strip of park), Azusa, Glendora. Had some time to think and enjoy some good music in the car. Eventually I found myself at that old familiar stretch of road, by Foothill and Indian Hill. I parked in the South Campus Garage and took a walk. I felt a little weird, like an outsider creeping around. Thankfully there were other older members of the community who had come to walk their dogs around the campus. The new athletics center is pretty fantastic. Used the bathroom at the Smith Campus Center. The door to Estella Hall was cracked open, so I slipped inside and walked the halls, for the first time in three years.</p>
