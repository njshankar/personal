      <p>A vintage Saturday. Started the day off with Chick fil-A iced coffee in Pasadena. Then drove to Claremont, locally. Mostly along Foothill Boulevard. Some really marvelous little towns along the way. Sierra Madre and Monrovia, which I've been to before. But also Duarte (with its long strip of park), Azusa, Glendora. Had some time to think and enjoy some good music in the car. Eventually I found myself at that old familiar stretch of road, by Foothill and Indian Hill. I parked in the South Campus Garage and took a walk. I felt a little weird, like an outsider creeping around. Thankfully there were other older members of the community who had come to walk their dogs around the campus. The new athletics center is pretty fantastic. Used the bathroom at the Smith Campus Center. The door to Estella Hall was cracked open, so I slipped inside and walked the halls, for the first time in three years.</p>
      <p>It felt a little bit surreal, seeing the math lounge and the physics l ounge and those classrooms where I used to sit for lecture and take notes and lead mentor sessions. None of the professors were in, predictably. After Estella I went to the library, where they let me in, no questions asked. Found a comfortable armchair on the third storey, took a seat. Watched the ending of the USC-Illinois game. I really wanted Illinois to win, especially after getting throttled by IU last week. Tuned in with two minutes left, to see the final drive and the game winning field goal. Seeing them win made me happy. It felt like a critical win, everyone had been calling the team frauds for the past week. But everything's going to be just fine.</p>
      <p>I cracked open <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em>, and my were there some juicy plot twists. I was just reaching the juciest of them all, when I realized it was to go eat some lunch. I went to a nearby food hall that popped up on Google Maps called Haven City Market. My, it was a pleasant surprise. So many different food stalls, a festive ambience. Clean and thoughtfully organized, lots of people hanging about. The football games were playing on a large screen, and there was an arcade full of plushie machines. It reminded me a little bit of a night market in Taiwan, in all the good ways. I ordered from a Taiwanese food stall, some garlic scallion noodles with an egg on top. It was quite good, at a nice price point ($12.50).</p>
      <p>Then I drove up to Ms. Kang's salon. I parked out back and she unlocked the door for me, as always. She immediately knew that I had gone to a different barber last time, and I meekly fessed up. Ms. Kang promptly spun into action, reclaiming my hair for her own. The haircut was relaxing. It felt like she gave an extra long shampoo massage this time. Afterwards she gave me some hot tea and wafers, and I reclined in the chair by the door, taking slow sips and admiring how tidy her shop was.</p>
      <p>Then it was time for a Rhino run. Unfortunately the CAS album I had been wanting to buy wasn't in stock this time. So I dug around the new arrivals section and stumbled upon Innvervisions, marked at a decent price point. Broke my $10 or under rule because $14.99 seemed hard to beat. I'm listening to it right now. I forgot how vibrant the bass on Higher Ground sounds. The sick drums on Too High, the tingling guitar on the title track. Definitely was a good buy.</p>
