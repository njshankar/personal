      <p>The first buffet was the most grandest of them all. A rainy Sunday in Taichung, an impressive queue bubbling into the lobby of the Lin Hotel. Nick and Tim whisper about handing Winston three thousand dollars in cash. I offer my Bank of Taiwan ATM card as another option. But our avuncular friend won't hear any of it. </p>
      <p>He ushers us into the restaurant. The waiter leads us through the crowded buffet area to our table, keeping his arm raised up the entire time. Impressive. We wonder if Winston will be able to find us. Just as we are about to go back to the entrance to look for him, we see him coming around the corner, led by another hand-raising waiter. Winston arrives at the table, and invites me to tour the options with him. Fruits of shapes and sizes, piled neatly into mounds that seem to stretch all the way to the ceiling. Turning left, next to the sesame balls and steamed buns, a mini-fridge stocked with cartons of milk tea. A selection of thai curries and vegetable stir fries. Walking forward, a lobster section, and beyond that, platters of sliced fish. A selection of Hong Kong style grilled meats. </p>
