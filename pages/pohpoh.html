      <h2>Remembering Grandmom (December 16, 2022 -- July 16, 2022)</h2>
      <p>As I got out of bed this morning, I found out through the family WhatsApp that my grandmom had passed away. She died at 9:05pm Macau time, on the evening of Saturday, July 16th, at the Instituto Canossiano Vila Madalena nursing home on Coloane Island. She had been discharged from the public hospital a few hours earlier. She passed away while sleeping, without any family by her side, because of the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns in Macau. </p>
      <p>I have been mentally preparing for this day for a long time. Seeing a photo of her at the hospital last Wednesday morning, I knew that her death was imminent. However, it still doesn't feel real, that my poh poh is no longer on this earth. </p>
      <p>She lived for 99 1/2 years. She gave birth to 11 children, raised 7 children to adulthood, had 15 grandchildren, and at least 5 great-grandchildren. </p> 
      <p>She grew up by the sea. Her dad worked at the harbour, moving fish from the boats to the market. She thus ate lots of fish in her childhood, and retained her love for eating fish over the rest of her life. It was her favourite food. My mom says that this is why her skin was always so clear and beautiful.</p> 
      <p>Her life was full of hardship. Her family was very poor. As a result, her stepmother (my granddad's mom), an egg seller, looked down on her and treated her badly. She never went to school. During World War II, the Japanese cut off the food supply to Macau. Her elder sister and father starved to death. </p> 
      <p>Her life was full of loss. She lost 4 children early on, having to give at least one away due to extreme poverty. Her mother and younger sister disappeared to Vietnam. Later, around the 1980s, her younger brother, whom she was very close to, became depressed and committed suicide. No one had the heart to tell her, so she assumed that he had forgotten about her, and thought him cruel. In 2007, my grandad passed away, and she lost her husband of over 50 years and became a widow. She lost another son eight years later, in 2015. She outlived nearly all of her friends and neighbors. </p>
      <p>She was very, very smart. She loved mahjong, and would play for several hours each day after retirement. Even well into her 90s, as recent as this year, she could perceive, anticipate, and remember things. Despite never going to school, and not seeing much value in education when my mom awas growing up, she always encouraged me to study hard. She helped me get into college. I wrote my application essay about her. I like to think that I have been studying for her, learning about things that she never had the chance to learn. </p>
