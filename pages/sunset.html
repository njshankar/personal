      <p>Now it's June. There are three weeks left in the school year. It is the sunset of my time in Taiwan. And for that, I can't help but feel a little bit sad. </p>
      <p>The beginning of May seems like it was just yesterday. An entire month left of school, rolled out before me like a grand buffet. The beginning of June? Well, that seems like a few hours ago. And now it's already June 9th.</p>
      <p>And where did the first four months of my time in Taiwan go? I still remember August well, because I had just arrived in Taiwan. A week-long quarantine at Rainbowtown Hotel, many changes, a few moves, meeting new people, a trip to Taipei to cap it off. But the months from September to December are a blur. It doesn't feel like I did very much. Inside of school, I didn't have much to do as the observing teacher. Outside of school, not very many grand adventures, besides going to Taroko most weekends and to the gym when I could muster the determination. Otherwise, I remember smaller things. A waterfall hike in Yilan. A walk around Meilun Mountain during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Grace, my co-teacher's wife, driving me to the scooter course to practice riding. Two memorable hikes at Taroko, first on the Zhuilu trail, and a couple months later, on the transcendant Wenshan trail. Sports day. A couple of rides along the east coast down to Taitung. Taking up piano again, inspired by one of my students, Tanny. Hanging out in the music room with some sixth grade students. A miserable trip down to a forest hot springs resort for the Fulbright Midyear Conference. That's pretty much it.</p>
      <p>In fact, it would seem that the real beginning of my time in Taiwan took place on January 24th, 2023. That was the day when I rode south on my scooter, beyond Taitung. A morning of forest bathing at Zhiben Park, basking amid the afternoon train-spotting throngs at Duoliang, winding my way down to the southern tip of Taiwan. That was the day I truly ventured into the unknown, tackling new experiences, for better or for worse (I got a $900 traffic ticket that day for riding my scooter through a car-only tunnel). And after some more travels, school began again. I found myself suddenly placed in charge of the classroom, which I saw as an exciting opportunity. Over the past few months, I've tried many new ideas. New games, classroom management strategies, homework assignments. Many fail. Some succeed. All don't go entirely the way I expect. </p>
      <p>I have prepared over 100 lesson plans, and taught some 250 class sections. Often the kids don't find the games or presentations I prepare for them nearly as fun or interesting as I'd hoped. I'm not a very charismatic person, and not having the best Mandarin ability ties a hand behind my back in regards to classroom management and having the full freedom to teach what I want. But there have been many, many good moments. An eager student answering or asking a question in class. Students enjoying and learning from a new kind of game. Students coming to my desk to come and play, or just chat (which happens nearly every period, it now seems). The 50 and 100 NTD purchases, respectively, of a deck of Sumikkogurashi playing cards and a knock-off Uno game at the 199 general goods store on my way back from school after the last day of the fall semester may be the best I have ever made. That Uno set, especially. Many hundreds of rounds must have been played with it. Won't the kids ever get bored of that game, I wonder? Apparently not yet. </p>
      <p>There are so many things I am thankful of this semester. The very kind and understanding members of the Fulbright Hualien co-hort. Being able to learn Clare de Lune and become friends with my school's music teacher (whose name is also Clare!). Thursday English workshops at Tzu Chi, which unexpectedly, have been such positive, relaxing spaces that I look forward to every week. The fifth grade boys who come to the English classroom every lunch to play games and talk about the NBA. The small third graders, who have such good-hearted energy. The somewhat unruly, but also good-hearted, fourth graders. The lethargic but dazzlingly bright sixth graders, who inspire me. Seeing many of my students perform singing and athletics at the Aboriginal Activities Center in May. A multitude of new adventures, both to places near (Batongguan Trail, Butterfly Valley, Zhuilu Road Part 2, Suhua Highway, Qixingtan, Qingshui Cliffs, Shapodang River, Mugu Muyu, Liyu Lake fireflies, the baseball stadium) and far (Taichung, Hehuanshan, Qingjing Farm, Puli, Yangmingshan, Bitan Park). Each and every day there are at least several moments that make me feel very warm. Today it was first looking at pictures on Facebook with my fifth grade students Charles and Eason. And then playing cards with my hardworking fifth grade student Amy. And then, at the teacher's office during lunch, watching my superstar fifth grade student Alvin (next year's school president!) diligently practicing his calligraphy. And then the girls from 6B wanting to try my mints, and making me pinky promise I would share with them after English class. And one period later, playing a few rounds of Wu Zi Qi with my 6A students (my student Momo was too good for me). And on my way to leave school, running into Su Qiong Lao Shi, who invited me to come see a baby sparrow that she had just rescued. And coming across a few other students in the teacher's office who were also curious about the bird. Will there be so many precious moments like these once I return to the U.S.?</p>
      <p>The older I get the more I feel that time is accelerating. That at some point, I entered some other dimension where time is warped. I think this point may have been in the middle of middle school, because my high school and college years seem to have gone by in a blink. And here I am, all of a sudden, supposedly a full-fledged adult, spit out from the other side of 16 consecutive years of schooling. And am I any smarter, having gone through all this academic training? Hardly, I feel. Anyways, perhaps this is why I feel so unexpectedly full teaching at this elementary school in Taiwan. Every day, I see these bright, energetic students, reminding me of the time before I entered the strange, accelerated dimension I've long found myself in. I really do hope that they're treasuring these days as much as I am. </p>
      <p>This past year, in spite of the changes it has brought, some of them difficult, has been blessed beyond measure. I can say with near certainty that I am the most content I have ever been. But this contentedness is increasingly laced with a sense of unease. I am so content, it seems, that it is hard to face the reality that yet more major changes are on the horizon. I am so content that it hard to feel content about a future that is so different from my present. I will miss Taiwan very much, and I will miss my students very much too, certainly more than they will miss me (I miss them already). But in the end, I have to trust that my contentedness runs deeper than any particular place or people. This is the sign of truly knowing God and finding peace in him. I will have to trust that when the sun is setting, the sun is rising somewhere else.</p>
