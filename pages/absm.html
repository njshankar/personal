      <p>There are three types of movies that tend to really resonate with me. </p>
      <p>The first type consists of the one-off wonders. Lacking a traditional narrative, they propel themselves on a streak of magic tricks. They leave me breathless at every moment, fearful that the magic will run out. The movies that can sustain such an otherworldly run of brilliance are very rare indeed. That's what makes them great in my book. I put movies like <em>Daisies</em>, <em>The Act of Killing</em>, <em>In a Year of 13 Moons</em>, and <em>Last Year at Marienbad</em> in this category.</p>
      <p>The second category is characterized by ruthlessly efficient exercises in stylistic and narrative craft. The envelopment of the viewer is gradual, seemingly effortless on the filmmaker's part.  Only a significant portion of the way in, if at all, do I realize that I've succumbed to the movie's spell. Bunuel's <em>Viridiana</em>, Kaurismaki's <em>Match Factory Girl</em>, and Hong Sang-soo's <em>Right Now, Wrong Then</em>, among others, exemplify this experience for me. </p>
      <p>Then there are the movies that proceed on an epic scale. By epic, I don't necessarily mean sprawling in length or cast size, but uniquely impressive in emotional grandeur. These movies don't have a <em>story</em>; they have an <em>arc</em>. I come away from them feeling that I've changed as a person over the course of my viewing. I feel tangibly older and more wise. Some movies that have had this type of effect on me are <em>To Live</em> and <em>The Godfather Part II</em>. Or Kubrick's <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>. Or Tarkovsky's <em>Mirror</em>. Or Hu Bo's <em>An Elephant Sitting Still</em>. Or Edward Yang's <em>A Brighter Summer Day</em>, which is what I hope to briefly write about here.</p>
