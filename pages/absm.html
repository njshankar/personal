      <p>There are three types of movies that tend to really resonate with me. </p>
      <p>The first type consists of the one-off wonders. Lacking a traditional narrative, they propel themselves on a streak of magic tricks. They leave me breathless at every moment, fearful that the magic will run out. The movies that can sustain such an otherworldly run of brilliance are very rare indeed. That's what makes them great in my book. I put movies like <em>Daisies</em>, <em>The Act of Killing</em>, <em>In a Year of 13 Moons</em>, and <em>Last Year at Marienbad</em> in this category.</p>
      <p>The second category is characterized by ruthlessly efficient exercises in stylistic and narrative craft. The envelopment of the viewer is gradual, seemingly effortless on the filmmaker's part.  Only a significant portion of the way in, if at all, do I realize that I've succumbed to the movie's spell. Bunuel's <em>Viridiana</em>, Kaurismaki's <em>Match Factory Girl</em>, and Hong Sang-soo's <em>Right Now, Wrong Then</em>, among others, exemplify this experience for me. </p>
      <p>Then there are the movies that proceed on an epic scale. By epic, I don't necessarily mean sprawling in length or cast size, but uniquely impressive in emotional grandeur. These movies don't have a <em>story</em>; they have an <em>arc</em>. I come away from them feeling that I've changed as a person over the course of my viewing. I feel tangibly older and more wise. Some movies that have had this type of effect on me are <em>To Live</em> and <em>The Godfather Part II</em>. Or Kubrick's <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>. Or Tarkovsky's <em>Mirror</em>. Or Hu Bo's <em>An Elephant Sitting Still</em>. Or Edward Yang's <em>A Brighter Summer Day</em>, which is what I hope to briefly write about here.</p>
      <p>The protagonist of the movie is Xiao Si'r, a middle school boy in 1960's Taipei. He lives in a quiet residential neigborhood with his mother, father, older brother, younger sister, and two older sisters. He possesses a natural gift for studies; but in the film's first scene, due to a poor test score in literature, he is forced to attend night school. There, he begins to associate with a street gang. He also strikes up a friendship with a beautiful girl named Ming, as well as a new classmate, a general's son with a reputation for violence. Si'r runs into trouble with his teachers a number of times. </p>
      <p>Two street gangs have been feuding with each other, resulting in some violent confrontations. To add more drama to things, the leader of one of the gangs is on the run after murdering someone; two of the other boys are competing to fill his place. One is the leader's brother and the other is a bully. Eventually the bully, whose father owns a large auditorium, gets together with the leader of the rival gang. They agree to host a rock-and-roll concert together, and split the sales. At this time, however, the gang leader who had run away returns. During his time in hiding, he read <em>War and Peace</em> and feels out of place back in Taipei. He's also Ming's boyfriend, and takes Si'r under his wing. Also, he's none too happy about the arrangement that his lieutant has made with the other gang. He confronts the other gang's leader on the night of the concert and gets pushed in front of an oncoming car. To retaliate, his brother reaches out to some hardcore gangsters; in an awesome, rain-soaked bloodbath, they storm the clubhouse of the rival gang, leaving a large trail of bodies.</p>
      <p>Si'r becomes quite attached to Ming. He sees it as his duty to protect her, given what happened to her boyfriend. However, he continues to get into trouble at school, and is eventually expelled. He promises to his father to study hard to get readmitted into day school. Soon after, his father is taken away for a night by the secret police. Si'r himself seems to be on an upward path. But after finding out that Ming has been fooling around with several other boys, he becomes enraged, and stabs her in the middle of the street. Such is the story, the film tells us, of the "first juvenile homicide case in Taiwan".</p>
