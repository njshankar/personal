      <p>I recently travelled to Asia for three weeks. I met many incredible people and went to many incredible places. When I was younger, one of my favorite books was called <em>MVP</em>. It was about boy who travelled around the world on his own. Back then, my dream was to travel around the world like him. And now that dream has come true, even though I am only 24 years old. Who has it better than I do?</p>
