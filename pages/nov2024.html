      <p>I recently travelled to Asia for three weeks. I was going to try write up a day-by-day account of my travels, but I realize that I am much too lazy for that. So maybe some short reflections would suffice. </p>

      <p>In a sense, I was looking forward to these travels for a long time. Ever since I left Taiwan back in July 2023, I have been missing it very much. Just like Ang Lee (as I recently found out when perusing his Wikipedia page), the period I spent in Hualien was an incredible run. What could be better than living in a seaside town with great food and warm people, teaching bright and talented students on weekdays and exploring beautiful nature on weekends? Life in Los Angeles, while not terrible, just never felt the same. I did not make many friends, I was adjusting to a new job, and I struggled to feel content with life in an expensive city with highly-visible problems.</p>
