      <p>I recently travelled to Asia for three weeks. I was going to try write up a day-by-day account of my travels, but I realize that I am much too lazy for that. So maybe some short reflections would suffice. </p>

      <p>I was looking forward to these travels for a long time. Ever since I left Taiwan back in July 2023, I have been missing it very much. Just like the young Ang Lee (as I recently found out when perusing his Wikipedia page), the period I spent in Hualien was an incredible run. What could be better than living in a seaside town with great food and warm people, teaching bright and talented students on weekdays and exploring beautiful nature on weekends? I longed for a reprise of this glorious past. And long before, growing up in a boring Midwestern suburban town, I always dreamed of travelling the world. One of my childhood favorite books was called <em>MVP</em>. It is a story about a boy who travels all around the world on his own. I always thought that this would be so cool! And now, in 2024, I finally had the funds to do a nice solo trip. So even many months before this November, I had the dates of my travels circled in my mental calendar. On some nights, I would stay up late anxiously trying to plan every detail and maximize my vacation time.</p>
      <p>But over time, something peculiar happened. I settled in to my life in Los Angeles. Quiet mornings in my quiet apartment. Church on Sundays. Et cetera. I got on a few projects and teams at work that I really enjoyed. At LAX airport on the evening of November 14th, ready to catch a flight to Taipei, I didn't feel excited, but sad. Sad for the life I was leaving behind, even if only for a few weeks. I also started to feel anxious that Taiwan wouldn't feel the same as last time, that by going back for another round I would ruin the magic of the first round. Or maybe the kids at school wouldn't even care that I came back. </p>
