      <p>Haven't written on here in a while. I've been busy with classes, but the semester wrapped up this week, so hopefully I'll have some more time to collect my thoughts. One of the classes I just finished was a class on Edgar Allan Poe, and his influence on Latin American fantastical short stories. Naturally, we read a number of short stories over the semester, so I thought it'd be a quick and fun exercise to rank them here.</p>
      <ol reversed>
        <li>Axolotl (Cortazar): There's an intriguing premise of metamorphosis and existential loneliness, and a playful tone with strong political undertones. Yet it's quite lacking in narrative momentum, and largely comes across as pretentious postmodernism. The ending feels forced. </li>
        <li>The Pit and the Pendulum (Poe): A spellbindingly surreal opening is spoiled by a contrived premise. Poe does a terrific job at building a deeply uncomfortable, claustrophobic atmosphere, and maybe I'm just jaded by the glut of modern-day survival tales, but hey, these rankings are mostly based on gut feeling, and this one pales in comparison to some of Poe's other work.</li>
        <li>Tarzan's Roar (Perri Rossi): More of a sketch rather than a story. But it's a biting commentary on American consumerism and problematic Hollywood mythologies all the same. Cleverly juxtaposes the lushness of Tarzan's jungle with a tacky postwar America, in which mythologies have bled into life so much that one can never be sure what is real and what is contrived. </li>
        <li>The Dead Man (Quiroga): Beautifully written, introspective tale of man versus nature, and, as its title suggests, coming to terms with one's mortality. I'm a bigger fan of some of Quiroga's other stories, though.</li>
        <li>Chac Mool (Fuentes): The . The horror is never quite convincing </li>
        <li></li>
