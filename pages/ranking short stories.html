      <p>Haven't written on here in a while. I've been busy with classes, but the semester wrapped up this week, so hopefully I'll have some more time to collect my thoughts. One of the classes I just finished was a class on Edgar Allan Poe, and his influence on Latin American fantastical short stories. Naturally, we read a number of short stories over the semester, so I thought it'd be a quick and fun exercise to rank them here.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <ol reversed>
        <li><b>Axolotl (Cortazar)</b>: There's an intriguing premise of metamorphosis and existential loneliness, and a playful tone with strong political undertones. Yet it's quite lacking in narrative momentum, and largely comes across as pretentious postmodernism. The ending feels forced. </li> <br>
        <li><b>The Pit and the Pendulum (Poe)</b>: A spellbindingly surreal opening is spoiled by a contrived premise. Poe does a terrific job at building a deeply uncomfortable, claustrophobic atmosphere, and maybe I'm just jaded by the glut of modern-day survival tales, but hey, these rankings are mostly based on gut feeling, and this one pales in comparison to some of Poe's other work.</li><br>
        <li><b>Tarzan's Roar (Perri Rossi)</b>: More of a sketch rather than a story. But it's a biting commentary on American consumerism and problematic Hollywood mythologies all the same. Cleverly juxtaposes the lushness of Tarzan's jungle with a tacky postwar America, in which mythologies have bled into life so much that one can never be sure what is real and what is contrived. </li><br>
        <li><b>The Dead Man (Quiroga)</b>: Beautifully written, introspective tale of man versus nature, and, as its title suggests, coming to terms with one's mortality. I'm a bigger fan of some of Quiroga's other stories, though.</li><br>
        <li><b>Chac Mool (Fuentes)</b>: Filiberto's writings about his life disappointments, lack of ambition, and dead-end career quite resonated with me, and Fuentes draws interesting parallels between colonial and indigenous religions. But the action takes a little while to develop, and the payoff is ultimately disappointing, as the horror is never quite convincing. </li><br>
        <li><b>The Circular Ruins (Borges)</b>: Ambivalent about this one. When I first read it, I thought it was complete pseudo-philosophical drivel, and the mind-numingly enigmatic, fabular style of writing felt cheap. However, this story has stayed in my thoughts for quite some time. I find the a lot of the imagery, (i.e., of the branches at the beginning, the imagined college, the magician's creation waving a banner atop the peak) to be inexplicably touching. It's an endearing tale of creation and a worthy love letter to the artistic process. </li><br>
        <li><b>Mona Lisa (Perri Rossi)</b>: I love how such a simple writing style is able to conjure such a lush fantasy landscape. I can feel the shroud of mist hanging over my skin as I read this story, a playful tale of voyeuristic obsessions that exists somewhere between the idealistic world of the canvas and the masterialistic world of reality.  </li><br>
        <li><b>Journey Back to the Source (Carpentier)</b>: Some of the most decadent writing my eyes have ever feasted upon. The reverse-chronological style is executed to perfection, as we trace a wealthy Don's journey from an old, bitter man to an extravagant playboy to a fun-loving child, glimpsing the transformation of Cuban society along the way. </li><br>
        <li><b>The Fall of the House of Usher (Poe)</b>: During my first few years of high school, this was my absolute favorite story of all time. Re-reading a few years later, I still marvel at its tragic narrative arc and thoroughly suffocating atmosphere (those first three pages are incredible). I only picked up on the currents of incest and necrophilia this time around, too (I was naive back then). While I still admire this story, and appreciate what it has to say about the transcendent nature of art, the writing does feel somewhat overwrought; as such, I prefer other stories now.</li><br>
        <li><b>The Black Cat (Poe)</b>: Probably the most purely terrifying of Poe's stories. He sucks us into a seemingly innocuous tale of "ordinary household events"; only towards the end do we realize we've been had, and have been sympathizing with a certified psychopath. Like many of Poe's other writings, some elements feel somewhat self-indulgent (such as the hangman's gallow on the cat), but few other tales I've read convey that sense of guilt, perversity, and animalistic urge so effectively. The story's final image has scarred me for life. </li><br>
        <li><b>The Decapitated Chicken (Quiroga)</b>: This is where these rankings get somewhat hard. Rich in symbolism, and incredibly gruesome and depraved; in the best way possible, of course.  </li><br>
        <li><b>The Murders in the Rue Morgue (Poe)</b>: Quite lengthy for a short story, but riveting all the same. Not only are we introduced to the iconic trio of Dupin, the narrator, and the hapless Paris prefect, but we're treated to an ingenious solution to a sickeningly graphic murder case. It may be contrived, but the line of thought which forms the second half of the story is exhiliarating; feels like a window (no pun intended) into Poe's ingenious spirit, mind and body both. </li><br>
        <li><b>The Feather Pillow (Quiroga)</b>: For most of its (incredibly short) length, it's a quirky, unassuming fairy tale, driven by seemingly inexplicable occurences. But it pays off in the best possible way. I was inclined to check my pillow for several nights after reading it.</li><br>
        <li><b>House Taken Over (Cortazar)</b>: I feel odd ranking this story so highly, as there's barely any narrative momentum to speak of, and the rip-offs from Fall of the House of Usher are quite blatant. Yet there's an irresistable atmosphere and sense of loss conveyed here. Something about the bourgeoisie narrator's apathy to everything that occurs around him feels so devastating. </li><br>
        <li><b>Death and the Compass (Borges)</b>: Everything that makes Borges so great (or un-great, depending on one's opinion) is in this dizzying, garish detective tale -- estoeric references to religion and mythology, liberal incorporation of labyrinths and Zeno's paradox, incredibly dense writing littered with patterns and misdirections. It works on many different levels; as a serial killer procedural, as a decadent tale of conspiracy, as a portrait of loneliness, suicide, and split identity. I really do think positions 3 to 7 in these rankings are a virtual tie.</li><br>
        <li><b>The Purloined Letter (Poe)</b>: What can I say about this one that hasn't already been said? It's the perfect tale, the ultimate treatise of Poe's intellectual philosophy. A gripping setup of sexual intrigue gives way to a battle of masculine mental supremacy that escalates to mythical proportions.</li><br>
        <li><b>The Night Face-Up (Cortazar)</b>: This tale shouldn't work. The fact that Cortazar is able to reconcile the tale of an anonymous motorcyle man living in an impressive modern city with a Moteca (clever wordplay and all) man evading bloodthirsty Aztecs in a pre-Columbian ritual war, so smoothly that it's hard to tell which is which, is a testament to his genius. By pulling off this audacious, Mobius-like mash-up, Cortazar reverses the flow of time between dream and reality, between a postcolonial present and an irrepressable indigenous past. Violence, it seems, is the only constant. Oh, and the story itself is positively horrifying, gradually building up to a fever pitch that seamlessly feeds back into the opening lines. </li>
