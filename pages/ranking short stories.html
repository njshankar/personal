      <p>Haven't written on here in a while. I've been busy with classes, but the semester wrapped up this week, so hopefully I'll have some more time to collect my thoughts. One of the classes I just finished was a class on Edgar Allan Poe, and his influence on Latin American fantastical short stories. Naturally, we read a number of short stories over the semester, so I thought it'd be a quick and fun exercise to rank them here.</p>
