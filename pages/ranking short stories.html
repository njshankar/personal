      <p>Haven't written on here in a while. I've been busy with classes, but the semester wrapped up this week, so hopefully I'll have some more time to collect my thoughts. One of the classes I just finished was a class on Edgar Allan Poe, and his influence on Latin American fantastical short stories. Naturally, we read a number of short stories over the semester, so I thought it'd be a quick and fun exercise to rank them here.</p>
      <ol reversed>
        <li>Axolotl (Cortazar): There's an intriguing premise of metamorphosis and existential loneliness, and a playful tone with strong political undertones. Yet it's quite lacking in narrative momentum, and largely comes across as pretentious postmodernism. The ending feels forced. </li> <br>
        <li>The Pit and the Pendulum (Poe): A spellbindingly surreal opening is spoiled by a contrived premise. Poe does a terrific job at building a deeply uncomfortable, claustrophobic atmosphere, and maybe I'm just jaded by the glut of modern-day survival tales, but hey, these rankings are mostly based on gut feeling, and this one pales in comparison to some of Poe's other work.</li><br>
        <li>Tarzan's Roar (Perri Rossi): More of a sketch rather than a story. But it's a biting commentary on American consumerism and problematic Hollywood mythologies all the same. Cleverly juxtaposes the lushness of Tarzan's jungle with a tacky postwar America, in which mythologies have bled into life so much that one can never be sure what is real and what is contrived. </li><br>
        <li>The Dead Man (Quiroga): Beautifully written, introspective tale of man versus nature, and, as its title suggests, coming to terms with one's mortality. I'm a bigger fan of some of Quiroga's other stories, though.</li><br>
        <li>Chac Mool (Fuentes): Filiberto's writings about his life disappointments, lack of ambition, and dead-end career quite resonated with me, and Fuentes draws interesting parallels between colonial and indigenous religions. But the action takes a little while to develop, and the payoff is ultimately disappointing, as the horror is never quite convincing. </li><br>
        <li>The Circular Ruins (Borges): Ambivalent about this one. When I first read it, I thought it was complete pseudo-philosophical drivel, and the mind-numingly enigmatic, fabular style of writing felt cheap. However, this story has stayed in my thoughts for quite some time (the imagery of the branches at the beginning, the magician's creation waving a banner atop the peak). It's an endearing tale of creation and a worthy love letter to the artistic process. </li><br>
