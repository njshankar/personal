      <h2>My Favorite Professors</h2>
      <p>Today is May 14, 2022. I'll be graduating from college tomorrow. One of the greatest aspects of my undergraduate time has been being able to learn from some exceptionally brilliant, dedicated, and caring professors. Here are five that I appreciate in particular: </p>
      <p>I can't begin with anyone other than <b> Prof. Edray Goins</b>. I took two and a half classes with him -- linear algebra in my very first semester, group theory in my second, and half of ring theory in my third (until I dropped). To be honest, his teaching style is not very interactive, which on certain days made me more inclined to tune out. His daunting homework assignments often made me lose sleep, and especially at the beginning, I found myself getting lost with professor's heavy use of abstract notation. There's something immensely soothing, though, about hearing Prof. Goins lecture, with his stacatto chalk movements, stacking of theorems upon theorems, handy visual diagrams, and historical/inguistic footnotes. Without even knowing it, I would find by end of lecture that, like a baptismal spring, the math had washed over me, helping me to emerge a more thoughtful and creative person. And the struggle helped me grow so, so much. I became better at persevering through difficult problems, and brainstorming routes to completing proofs. I became better at communicating mathematics, both in writing, and in speaking. I became part of a community -- a few of my best friends today include my linear classmates. Prof. Goins is the reason that I, as an insecure freshman, decided to major in math. He also is the reason I became a math mentor for six semesters, in the process discovering my love for teaching, building my mathematical confidence, and being able to have blissful mathematical and non-mathematical conversations with scores of lovely students. Despite some missteps that I made (iykyk), he's the first professor who I felt ever had my back, and that means so much to me. And I'm not even getting to how much Prof. Goins does for the mathematical community as a whole! Beyond being a brilliant mathematician, he also does so much to help underrepresented groups break into mathematics, whether it's through his summer programs, leadership roles, or project to expand the MAD database of black mathematicians (I had the privilege of helping out with this one in a very tiny way). He was even featured in the NYT during my second semester (the arcticle itself, about how few black mathematicians there are, was very sad). Anyways, I love Prof. Goins and will really miss him. He's a great teacher, and an even better mentor and inspiration! </p>
      <p>Next comes <b> Prof. Janice Hudgings</b>. I took one and a half classes with her -- an intro physics lab section in my first semester, and foundations of modern physics (Physics 101) in my third. The latter class, though, should really have counted as three classes, because there were A LOT of assignments (like 10 per week). But it was one of my favorite classes at Pomona, because Prof. Hudgings went out of her way to offer lots of support and make things very inclusive. I remember that she'd have little reading quizzes due before every class, and she'd read the responses carefully. One time, I made a dumb pun about the Schrodinger equation, and she complimented it! She'd offer exams in a two-pass style -- the first pass individually, and the second pass in groups, with the score being the average of the two -- which took lots of pressure off. She also made herself really available during labs, and was a really fun and engaging lecturer. Another thing that made Physics 101 great (and more work intensive!) was the decolonizing STEM component. She'd assign readings on diversity in STEM each week -- mostly sociological kind of papers on things like implicit bias, the stereotype threat, and microagressions. She'd then set aside time in the middle of lab periods on Tuesdays for the class to discuss the readings, accompanied by tea and snacks. But what I appreciate most about Prof. Hudgings is how accessible she is. Physics is a really intimidating subject, and Prof. Hudgings is madly accomplished: a Rhodes Scholar, a full professor, a published experimentalist in top journals. Yet she wasn't afraid to point out her mistakes in class, and to admit that she sometimes had trouble understanding things. I remember that during the lab process, we were supposed to write a final research paper. At the end of the semester, she took us through a mock peer review process with these, and in introducing peer review, she talked about how disappointed she was that a recent submission she made had been rejected. This very slight comment made me feel much more confident that, if Prof. Hudgings experienced rejections and setbacks, and yet found so much success, so could I. And, I'm not even mentioning how I worked as a writing partner for her Physics 101 labs during my junior and senior falls, and saw firsthand how much time she spends planning her courses. I didn't end up majoring in physics, but I'll always look fondly on my time with Prof. Hudgings. </p>
      <p>The COVID pandemic came right in the middle of my college experience. In Fall of 2021, classes were online, and I generally felt quite despondent about things. Upon recommendation from my friend Nathalie, I enrolled in an Environmental History course with <b> Prof. Pey-Yi Chu</b>. Now, whenever anyone asks me about what my favorite class at Pomona was, I'll respond with this course. Prof. Chu (an environemntal historian herself), set things up like a book club. There was lots of reading, but the articles and books she selected were so interesting and definitely broadened my worldview. Texts like <em>Mosquitio Empires</em>, <em>Late Victorian Holocausts</em>, and <em>The Mushroom at the End of the World</em> stay in my mind to this day. The class was pretty small, and, Prof. Chu facilitated some truly unforgettable discussions. Also, in recognition of the pandemic, she instituted an effort-based grading system. This was a godsend, allowing me to worry less about grades, and focus more on enjoying and learning the material. What I'm most grateful for, however, is how the class helped me grow as a speaker. Her discussions challenged me to verablize thoughts on weighty issues like the nature of interactions between humans and their environment, and at the end of each unit, she'd assign video blog reflections, which forced me to improve at synthesizing and summarizing information on camera. It would not be exaggerating to say that taking her class is one of the main reasons why I was able to become a better interviewer and get hired. And while I was only dabbling in history for that one semester, I'm definitely a better thinker, too. Tremendously brilliant yet caring professors like Prof. Chu (who blocks out two hours before each class for planning!) helped me feel academically accepted and empowered to find and use my voice. </p> 
      <p>During Spring 2021 semester, I enrolled in my first class over at Claremont McKenna College, with <b> Prof. Mark Huber</b>. From the very first Zoom class, which exhibited his nifty camera setup and crystal clear lecturing style, I knew I was in for a treat. Each class period was 50 minutes, and each lecture felt like a little bit-sized treat. We covered a wide swath of topics in simulation theory, randomization, Markov Chains, random walks, measure theory, derivative pricing, and cryptography. Even online, I always looked forward to learning from Prof. Huber. His homework assignments and tests were very straightforward, reinforcing the concepts well. He also weaved an R programming component into the course, which helped me improve a lot at the language. If I ever become a math professor one day, I'd aspire to be as organized and clear as him. </p>
      <p>One more outstanding professor I studied with was <b>Prof. Minxin Pei</b>, another CMC professor. To be honest, I only enrolled in his class because I couldn't get into International Relations of East Asia with Pomona professor Prof. Tom Le, and my friend Kristine recommended Prof. Pei's class as a replacement. But if Prof. Chu's Environmental History class is my favorite undergrad class, then Prof. Pei's Chinese Politics class is a very close second. First, Prof. Pei is one of the most prominent China experts out there, having written many influential books, held positions at top universities and think tanks, and regularly published op-ends in popular media outlets. But being an expert is one thing, being a good teacher is another. Fortunately, however, Prof. Pei was not only a good teacher, but a legendary one. He'd come to class with detailed sets of slides that broke down the different theories and historical tidbits -- different political factions at various periods of the post-Mao era, Xi Jinping's extensive security apparatus, mapping China's possible future paths in its rivalry with the US -- in an incredibly logical and digestible fashion. He'd assign lots of readings for each class, but each one would be really insightful and informative, including not just history and political science theories, but also things like media profiles of Chinese leaders, pieces about China's economic and demographic situations, and research on the country's rural-urban divide. The questions he posed sparked some really interesting discussions that regularly drew participation from the entire class of around 20 people. While he had high standards in grading (he absolutely shredded my second essay), I felt so honored that he read my work and took it seriously. I had to pinch myself every day to remind myself that I really was learning about China from such a legendary scholar as him. Yes, he's quite opinionated, and perhaps a little bit full of himself, but for such an authoritative figure, I could hardly blame him. Studying with him was so much fun, and I'm so glad that I got to tap into a tiny fraction of his massive reserve of knowledge. </p> 
      <p>Of course, I'm also thankful for so many other professors and staff members at Pomona. Just to name a few more: <b>Prof. Adolfo Rumbos</b>, who let me into his Vector Calculus class midway into my fall sophomore semester, became my advisor, and is one of the funniest, sweetest teachers I have had; invaluable research mentors like the brilliant <b>Prof. Ami Radunskaya</b> and <b>Prof. Emiliano Huet-Vaughn</b>, who taught me so much; my senior thesis advisor <b>Prof. Sherilyn Tamagawa</b>; <b>Prof. Darryl Yong</b>, who was a shining light to me during my first COVID summmer; <b>Mike M-P</b> and <b>Sena Filihia</b>, the tremendously supportive staff at the AARC, who helped me grow in my identity and find community; other engaging and caring teachers like <b>Prof. Pierre Englebert</b> from politics, <b>Prof. Robin Melnick</b> from linguistics, and <b>Prof. Michael Orrison</b> from math. </p>
