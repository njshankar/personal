      <h2>My Favorite Professors</h2>
      <p>Today is May 14, 2022. I'll be graduating from college tomorrow. One of the greatest aspects of my undergraduate time has been being able to learn from some exceptionally brilliant, dedicated, and caring professors. Here are five that I appreciate in particular: </p>
      <p>I can't begin with anyone other than <b> Prof. Goins</b>. I took two and a half classes with him -- linear algebra in my very first semester, group theory in my second, and half of ring theory in my third (until I dropped). To be honest, his teaching style is not very interactive, which on certain days made me more inclined to tune out. His daunting homework assignments often made me lose sleep, and especially at the beginning, I found myself getting lost with professor's heavy use of abstract notation. There's something immensely soothing, though, about hearing Prof. Goins lecture, with his stacatto chalk movements, stacking of theorems upon theorems, handy visual diagrams, and historical/inguistic footnotes. Without even knowing it, I would find by end of lecture that, like a baptismal spring, the math had washed over me, helping me to emerge a more thoughtful and creative person. And the struggle helped me grow so, so much. I became better at persevering through difficult problems, and brainstorming routes to completing proofs. I became better at communicating mathematics, both in writing, and in speaking. I became part of a community -- a few of my best friends today include my linear classmates. Prof. Goins is the reason that I, as an insecure freshman, decided to major in math. He also is the reason I became a math mentor for six semesters, in the process discovering my love for teaching, building my mathematical confidence, and being able to have blissful mathematical and non-mathematical conversations with scores of lovely students. Despite some missteps that I made (iykyk), he's the first professor who I felt ever had my back, and that means so much to me. And I'm not even getting to how much Prof. Goins does for the mathematical community as a whole! Beyond being a brilliant mathematician, he also does so much to help underrepresented groups break into mathematics, whether it's through his summer programs, leadership roles, or project to expand the MAD database of black mathematicians (I had the privilege of helping out with this one in a very tiny way). He was even featured in the NYT during my second semester (the arcticle itself, about how few black mathematicians there are, was very sad). Anyways, I love Prof. Goins and will really miss him. He's a great teacher, and an even better mentor and inspiration! </p>
      <p>Next comes <b> Prof. Hudgings</b>. I took one and a half classes with her -- an intro physics lab section in my first semester, and foundations of modern physics (Physics 101) in my third. The latter class, though, should really have counted as three classes, because there were A LOT of assignments (like 10 per week). But it was one of my favorite classes at Pomona, because Prof. Hudgings went out of her way to offer lots of support and make things very inclusive. I remember that she'd have little reading quizzes due before every class, and she'd read the responses carefully. One time, I made a dumb pun about the Schrodinger equation, and she complimented it! She'd offer exams in a two-pass style -- the first pass individually, and the second pass in groups, with the score being the average of the two -- which took lots of pressure off. She also made herself really available during labs, and was a really fun and engaging lecturer. Another thing that made Physics 101 great (and more work intensive!) was the decolonizing STEM component. She'd assign readings on diversity in STEM each week -- mostly sociological kind of papers on things like implicit bias, the stereotype threat, and microagressions. She'd then set aside time in the middle of lab periods on Tuesdays for the class to discuss the readings, accompanied by tea and snacks. But what I appreciate most about Prof. Hudgings is how accessible she is. Physics is a really intimidating subject, and Prof. Hudgings is madly accomplished: a Rhodes Scholar, a full professor, a published experimentalist in top journals. Yet she wasn't afraid to point out her mistakes in class, and to admit that she sometimes had trouble understanding things. I remember that during the lab process, we were supposed to write a final research paper. At the end of the semester, she took us through a mock peer review process with these, and in introducing peer review, she talked about how disappointed she was that a recent submission she made had been rejected. This very slight comment made me feel much more confident that, if Prof. Hudgings experienced rejections and setbacks, and yet found so much success, so could I. And, I'm not even mentioning how I worked as a writing partner for her Physics 101 labs during my junior and senior falls, and saw firsthand how much time she spends planning her courses. I didn't end up majoring in physics, but I'll always look fondly on my time with Prof. Hudgings. </p>
