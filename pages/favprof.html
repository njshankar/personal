      <h2>My Favorite Professors</h2>
      <p>Today is May 14, 2022. I'll be graduating from college tomorrow. One of the greatest aspects of my undergraduate time has been being able to learn from some exceptionally brilliant, dedicated, and caring professors. Here are five that I appreciate in particular: </p>
      <p>I can't begin with anyone other than <b> Prof. Goins</b>. I took two and a half classes with him -- linear algebra in my very first semester, group theory in my second, and half of ring theory in my third (until I dropped). To be honest, his teaching style is not very interactive, which on certain days made me more inclined to tune out. His daunting homework assignments often made me lose sleep, and especially at the beginning, I found myself getting lost with professor's heavy use of abstract notation. There's something immensely soothing, though, about hearing Prof. Goins lecture, with his stacatto chalk movements, stacking of theorems upon theorems, handy visual diagrams, and historical/inguistic footnotes. Without even knowing it, I would find by end of lecture that, like a baptismal spring, the math had washed over me, helping me to emerge a more thoughtful and creative person. And the struggle helped me grow so, so much. I became better at persevering through difficult problems, and brainstorming routes to completing proofs. I became better at communicating mathematics, both in writing, and in speaking. I became part of a community -- a few of my best friends today include my linear classmates. Prof. Goins is the reason that I, as an insecure freshman, decided to major in math. He also is the reason I became a math mentor for six semesters, in the process discovering my love for teaching, building my mathematical confidence, and being able to have blissful mathematical and non-mathematical conversations with scores of lovely students. Despite some missteps that I made (iykyk), he's the first professor who I felt ever had my back, and that means so much to me. And I'm not even getting to how much Prof. Goins does for the mathematical community as a whole! Beyond being a brilliant mathematician, he also does so much to help underrepresented groups break into mathematics, whether it's through his summer programs, leadership roles, or project to expand the MAD database of black mathematicians (I had the privilege of helping out with this one in a very tiny way). He was even featured in the NYT during my second semester (the arcticle itself, about how few black mathematicians there are, was very sad). Anyways, I love Prof. Goins and will really miss him. He's a good teacher, and an even better mentor and inspiration! </p>
      <p>I can't begin with anyone other than <b> Prof. Hudgings</b>. I took two and a half classes with Prof. Goins. I studied linear algebra with him during my first semester at Pomona in Fall 2018. Coincidentally enough, this was also his first semester at Pomona, as he'd moved from Purdue the spring before. I had lacked confidence in my math abilities throughout high school</p>
