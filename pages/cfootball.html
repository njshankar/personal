      <p>The last few weeks have firmed up my opinion that college football is the best sport. Like college basketball, it's often incredibly sloppy, which is always fun. Football game scores such as 70-56, 59-53, and 78-0 titilate me greatly. As do endless streams of failed two-point conversions, missed chip shot field goals, illegal forward passes to offensive linemen, and game-winning blocked punt returns for touchdowns.  
        
      <p>The best part of college football however is the fact that it's wildly arbitrary. In college football you have 30 games to a season, so by tournament time, you've got a reasonable sample for telling who's good and who's bad (although of course, anything can happen on any given day). Number crunchers like Ken Pom can peg things down pretty well. In college football, the high-minded data analysts are replaced by dumb-as-rocks computer algorithms and wildly-entertaining buffoons like Paul Finebaum. </p>
