      <p> There's a certain movie called <em>Millenium Mambo</em>. In the opening scene, we see the back of a young woman. Surrounding her on all sides are these blinding blue lights, and rows of semicircular windows stretching out infinitely on both sides. She seems to be encased in some bullet train of the future. An ambient rock song plays. The floaty camera clings tightly to the woman's silhouette as she struts through the snaking chamber, hair swinging at her back. Then, the same woman, ten years later, begins to recount her turbulent times of youth. Rooted in the present moment, yet tinged with compassionate nostalgia, these two minutes of cinema are nothing short of magical. When I found out that they were filmed on a pedestrian bridge in Keelung, visiting the rainy port town became an obsession. </p>
      <p> Thanks to a certain friend from the United States who was working there around the 2/28 holiday, I found a perfect excuse to make the trip. On the train ride from Qidu to Keelung, I felt excitement from deep in my heart. A longstanding dream was finally being fulfilled. The bridge itself was modest, tucked away by the back side of the railway station. It was largely devoid of foot traffic, save for a photographer and his beautiful muse who were paying homage to Hou Hsiao-hsien. I walked through the bridge once, and then slowly back across again, taking the same route Shu Qi had taken in <em>Milennium Mambo</em>. Then I set off for my friend's apartment, stopping at the night market along the way to grab some cold noodles. It was the most crowded one I have seen in all of Taiwan. </p>
