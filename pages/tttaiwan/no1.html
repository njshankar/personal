      <p> The first time I went to Tamsui was in August, just over one year ago. It was for the teacher's conference. Our organization put us up in a fancy five-star hotel located on fisherman's wharf. During the days I would hobnob around the grand conference rooms of the hotel, enjoying the company of my new teacher acquaintances, some of the finest people that I've ever met. During the nights I would stroll out and walk on the pier, admiring the waters at sunset. One morning, on the last day, I woke up very early and walked up the road to a beach where the river empties into the ocean. I remember being filled with the excitement of a new beginning in a new place that I'd quickly come to love. </p>
      <p> The second time I went to Tamsui was quite a bit later, in April of the next year. I had come to Taipei for the weekend to meet some friends. We met up at a hotel and had a nice chat over some drinks. Then we went over to a nightclub by the expo park. Unfortunately, midway through I became dizzy and had to sit outside in the chilly night air. I woke up the next day feeling terrible. Misguidedly, I decided to take an afternoon excursion to Tamsui. The entire time, I was about to pass out. Eventually I decided to cut my losses and caught the first train back to Hualien. My weeekend in Taipei had been an utter failure. It was one of the low point of the year that I spent in Taiwan. </p>
      <p> The third and last time I went to Tamsui was three months later, at the end of July. I had gone up to Taipei for the weekend to see my family friend Aunt 銘. At her suggestion, I went to Tamsui on Sunday afternoon to catch the sunset. The scene was much the same as I'd remembered from April -- the elderly troupe of dancers in the station square; the children running alongside pigeons on the grass; the vendors selling all kinds of souvenirs and snacks; the street performers, ranging from a woman banging on pots and pans to a man covered in silver paint doing tricks on his bicycle. All of this under the watchful eye of Mount Guanyin, the broad-based hill that I'd first seen from my hotel window eleven months earlier.</p>
      <p> I paid $80 for the round-trip ferry to Bali. Over there, I bought some 雙胞胎 and ice cream and took a short walk. Bali had a more laid-back vibe compared to its sister on the other side of the river, with many waterfront parks and small beaches where children played. From a distance, I could see Tamsui, perched atop a hill spread along the water. I took the ferry back about thirty minutes before sunset and began walking upriver. Not too far ahead, I could see the point where river meets ocean. High above, in the vast blue sky, clouds were arrayed in long strands and seemed to be on fire. It was one of the most spectacular sunsets I have ever seen. </p>
      <p> If I'd kept walking, I could have reached the grand hotel at fisherman's wharf, the very location where my journey began. But by then it would have been pitch dark. So I turned around and headed back to the station. The simple act of turning around has seldom brought me so much sadness. It was a magical ending to a magical year. </p>
