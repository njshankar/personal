      <p> The first time I went to Tamsui was in August, just over one year ago. It was for the teacher's conference. They put us up in a fancy hotel located on fisherman's wharf. I would pass the days in its stately ballrooms, sipping tea and watching keynote speeches. I would pass the evenings on the pier, admiring the boats on the water at sunset. One morning, on the final day, I woke up very early and walked up the road to a beach where the river empties into the ocean. I remember being filled with the excitement of a new beginning in a new place that I'd quickly come to love. </p>
      <p> The second time I went to Tamsui was quite a bit later, in April of the next year. I had come to Taipei for the weekend to meet some friends. We had a nice chat over some drinks at the Greenworld Hotel. Then we shuttled over to a nightclub next to the expo park. Once there, it soon became apparent that I'd downed a few too many shots of sorghum at the hotel. I stepped out of the club and sat outside in the chilly night air until my companions were ready to go home. I felt dreadful the following morning. Misguidedly, I decided to take a little excursion to Tamsui. The entire time I was there, I wanted to fall asleep. I eventually decided to cut my losses and caught the first Taroko Express train back to Hualien. That weeekend in Taipei had been an utter failure. It was one of the low point of the year that I spent in Taiwan. </p>
      <p> The third and last time I went to Tamsui was three months later, at the end of July. I had gone up to Taipei for the weekend to see my family friend Aunt 銘. At her suggestion, I went to Tamsui on Sunday afternoon to catch the sunset. The scene was much the same as I'd remembered from April -- the elderly troupe of dancers in the station square; the children running alongside pigeons on the grass; the vendors selling all kinds of souvenirs and snacks; the street artists and karaoke singers; and all of this under the watchful eye of Guanyin Mountain.</p>
      <p> I paid $80 and bought a round-trip ticket to Bali. After disembarking, I bought some 雙胞胎 and ice cream and took a short walk. Bali had a more relaxed atmosphere compared to its sister on the other side of the water. There were many waterfront parks and small beaches where children played. From a distance, I could see Tamsui, perched atop a hill and spread along the riverbank. I rode back there about thirty minutes before sunset and began walking upriver. Not too far ahead, I could see the point where river meets ocean. High above, in the vast blue sky, clouds were arrayed in long strands and seemed to be on fire. It was one of the most spectacular sights I have ever seen. </p>
      <p> If I'd kept walking, I could have reached the grand hotel at fisherman's wharf, the very location where my journey had begun eleven months earlier. But by then it would have been pitch dark. So I turned around and headed back to the station. </p>
