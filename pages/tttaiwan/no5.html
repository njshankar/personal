      <p> The Taipei Zoo is a lit place. The admission fee is $100 -- shockingly low! On a November Saturday, it was jam packed with moms, dads, and little ones. </p>
      <p> We saw the flamingoes. Also the birds, the sloths, and a Formosan black bear. Macaques (you really don't need to go to a zoo to see them, though). The pandas, which were feeling shy that day. The butterfly house, featuring one super cool specimen that would fold up its wings and look just like a leaf. The royally epic pangolin dome, which featured jumbo fish, peacocks, and (surprise, surprise) pangolins. The orangutans, the capybaras, and best of all -- the elephants. </p>
      <p> There were two elephants, and they looked like such good friends. They would tangle their trunks together and roar out in laughter. Their wrinkles made them appear infinitely wise. They were merry as any two creatures I have seen during my twenty three years on earth. Eventually they decided playtime was over and that it was time for bathtime. One after the other, they trotted over to the pond, gradually sinking their feet in the muddy waters. And suddenly ... Plosh! In went the tummies. </p>
      <p> That was where we left them. I had a train to catch at the station. With a heavy heart, bid farewell to my friend, retraced my steps, and headed out of the zoo grounds. But not before buying a panda-themed calendar stand at the gift shop. I took it to school and put it on my desk there. The kids found it to be a lot of fun.   </p>
