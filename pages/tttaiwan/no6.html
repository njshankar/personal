      <p> Kenting is very small, but there was a lot to do there. I stayed at a cute little pod hotel in Nanwan. The lounge was stocked with card games and freshly-made wintermelon tea. The balcony looked out on the beach. </p>
      <p> Those days, I'd more or less do whatever I felt. The first day, I went to Kenting National Forest. It was nothing to write home about, but there were some cool caves formed by coral uplifted from the sea. Seeing so many families there during the holiday period made me feel a little lonely. I snacked on some ice cream and tea eggs at a market nearby, and wandered through Sheding Park, which was similar, but a lot less busy. One pavillion on a bluff and offered incomparable views of the nearby coastline. As the weather was slightly cloudy that day, I got to see a rainbow as well. </p>
      <p> That afternoon, I took a walk around the grounds of Eluanbi Park, and went to Taiwan's southermost point simply because I thought it would be cool. For dinner, I rode on over to the night market. Booth after booth stretched out for what must have been at least five blocks, selling every kind of food imaginable, from Thai to Indian to Italian. After sun set, throngs of tourists would crowd the street, making the town feel like one big party. </p>
      <p> The next day I went in the other direction (west) and stumbled upon a temple high upon a hill. There was a garden nearby from which I could see a relatively isolated stretch of shore. From there I went to Maobitou to watch the crashing waves, and around lunchtime I aimlessly ambled about Hengchun. A group of old men were playing cards next to the ancient city walls. Eventually, I rode back across Kenting to Jialeshui, where a long path traced the rocky coastline. After having some killer ice cream at Gangkou, I hung out at Longpan Park, a grassland overlooking the sea. I would have stayed for sunset, but I was too hungry. For dinner I went to the trusty old Kenting Night Market yet again. This time, however, I carried out and brought it back to the hostel lounge. There, I encountered a friendly man named Kenjy from Taichung, who was travelling with his family. He offered me some beers and we had a good chat while his kids punched away on their I-phones. </p>
      <p> It was a warm conclusion to what had been a liberating and relaxing, albeit somewhat lonesome stay in Kenting. I left quite early the next day, so I could meet my friend Ashley for lunch in Pingtung. As I exited Kenting, I felt a tinge of sadness. The lush wonderland on Taiwan's southern tip really is a special place. </p>
