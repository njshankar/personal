      <p> Going all the way to Puli, by way of the Central Cross-Island Highway was my greatest adventure in Taiwan over the past year. Puli is the geographical center of Taiwan. They have a little steely monument that marks it by the side of the road. On my way out of town, on the final day, I made a brief stop there. It was a cool memory, to be sure, but a mere blip among what I had done over the past two days. </p>
      <p> Because Puli is the gateway to Sun Moon Lake. A thirty minute ride by scooter was all it took. I happened to get there quite late in the day. If I'd arrived earlier, perhaps I would have had the time to go biking! Instead, I settled for a nice walk along Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek's private wharf. From the well-travelled path I admired the lake's calm turqoise waters and the lush forested hills on the other side. To my pleasant surprise, the towns along the shore were few and far between. After finishing my walk, I continued riding around the lake, all the way to the pagoda which sat high upon a hill on the opposite shore. The sign at the parking lot said that the building closed at 4:00pm. I was almost an hour late. Gripped by wishful thinking and dreams of how good the view would be from the top, I nevertheless started upon the one-kilometer uphill path that led to the pagoda's door. </p>
