      <h2>Winter travels, part II</h2>
      <p>I was in Hualien for two days after the conclusion of my journey down south. It felt good to get some rest, and I'm sure my scooter felt the same way. On February 1st, though, I began another journey, with Anna, a friend back from the United States. I met her that afternoon in Taipei, after killing some time at the Taiwan National Museum in 228 Park. While the museum is rather small, I enjoyed the exhibits about Taiwan's society, people, and animals. Anyways, at 3, we checked into the hotel in Ximen. My friend was very tired after her travels, so she slept in the room while I took a very long walk around Taipei. I went up to Dihua Street, taking in the post-New Year scene. None of the stores was very interesting to me except for a historical building that had been turned into a three-story bookstore. I wandered over east and found myself in Zhongshan. I met a woman on the path, trying to sell me a class at her fitness studio. She was very friendly so I indulged her, and she took me over to the studio, less than a block away. Apparently, you can take classes there, such as yoga, boxing, and trampoline jumping, and then eat a homemade, healthy desert afterwards. A cool concept! The woman was also very fit. Even though she was over 50 years old, she looked not a day over 30. I'd still like to be able to go back to Taipei someday and try one of the classes (they're quite affordable, only $550). After my detour to the fitness studio, I continued walking southwards until arriving at the Zhongshan station area. There were a lot of people walking about, and the atmostphere was festive, with lanterns set up everywhere, and the Christmas decorations still up as well. I waded through seas of people at the Fuxing Road intersection and went inside the Eslite mall. The Eslite there is huge! It has a supermarket, large stationery section, and an entire room dedicated to English books. The Hualien store has no English books at all. I went back to the hotel. My friend woke up, and we went around Ximen at night. I've been to Ximen a couple of times now. The bright lights, the street performers, all the young people walking around, they make me feel so alive. </p>

      <p>The following four days we stayed in Taipei. Day 1 we saw the Houtong Cat Village, and after getting on the wrong bus, found ourselves in Banqiao. We went to the Nanya night market and got a nice massage in the evening at a place next door to the hotel. Day 2 we took the train up to Shifen. Although I found the old street slightly cheesy, the waterfall was very impressive! In the evening we went to Shilin to meet up with a friend from school Elaine and her traveling party. Her father treated us to dinner. Day 3 I walked around Daan park while my friend went to the gym. I also walked through the holiday flower and jade markets, as well as Huashan Creative Park. A very nice walk. Then, in the afternoon, we went to Beitou. Day 4, we went to a book exposition in Xinyi (the largest in asia!) and then back to Shifen for the sky lantern festival. Even though it was rainy and crowded, the sight of all those lanters was very cool. The rabbit's carrot burned up in the trees. </p>

      <p>The next day we took the train to Hsinchu to see our friend Kristine. We climbed up Shibajianshan. Lots of people were out on the trail. The view at the top was nice, despite the overcast weather. Kristine's father treated us to a vegetarian dinner at the large shopping mall, and afterwards we boarded the train to Kaohsuing, arriving there slightly after midnight. The next day, we rode the subway up to the Lotus Pond. A very tranquil place. The Dragon and Tiger Pagodas were closed. In the afternoon, walked around Monkey Mountain and the British Consulate. The views of the harbor were amazing. We ended the day at the Liuhe Night Market. The next day, in my opinion, was even better. We rented scooters in the morning, and rode to the Fo Guang Shan Monastery. The vegetarian buffet was delicious, and it was a lot of fun to stroll the grounds. Apparently the founder of the monastery had died just a couple days earlier, so we saw lots of people who had come to mourn him. After departing the monastery, we took a joyride through Kaohsuing that ended at the Cijin Lighthouse, where we saw the sunset. Then we walked around the Dream Mall (so large!), and rode the ferris wheel for $150 (not really worth it). The next day was our Tainan day. We didn't actually see too much beyond the Chikan Tower and Anping Tree House, but saw and had lots of good food. Our final day, we walked around Hayashi Department Store and took the train back to Hualien.</p>
