      <h2>Let's end with a recap, Vol. II</h2>
      <p> The date is December 31st, and once again, it is time for a recap. </p>
      <h3>Early January</h3>
  <!--    <p> January began quietly. The weather in Hualien was crisp, and the end of the first semester at school was near. I looked on my secondary role in the third, fifth, and sixth grade classew with quiet frustration. On the other hand, with the fourth grade classes (which had a different co-teacher), I had taken more initiative to plan classroom activities. I took a proud sense of teacherly ownership in seeing my fourth graders' excitement at each English class, smiling and high-fiving me as they walked in the door, and becoming more and more confident with the vocabulary (the unit was on food!) with each passing day. This is why it was heartbreaking for me to be whisked away to the Fulbright mid-year conference just before final exams. Would they lose momentum without one of their teachers in the classroom to help them prepare?</p>
      <p> The conference itself was a low-point. It took place in a spa resort located in the middle of the mountains just south of Taipei City. The hotel grounds had many sculptures of dinosaurs, which was fun, I guess. But all the networking quickly wore me out and towards the end of the conference, I became as sick as a dog. </p> -->

        <p>I climbed down the steps of the embassy to the ruins of an old fort by the sea and watched the ships enter and leave the port. This was the moment when Kaohsuing became one of my favourite cities in Taiwan.</p>

        <p>On almost every Thursday night, I had dinner at the small Tai Chang Night Market. Many of my students, who lived in the area, would come with their parents to eat.</p>

        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm5.jpg">
        <p>Later, still during 2/28 break, I visited my good friend Anna in Keelung for one day, and fulfilled my cinephile dream of walking on the Zhongshan Bridge from <em>Milennium Mambo</em>.</p>

        <p>The view from Jiufen, which we visited for around thirty minutes. I really can't overstate how magical that day in Keelung was. The weather was sunny and bright, the sky and ocean bright blue.</p>

        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm9.jpg">

        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm12.jpg">
        <p>My first visit to the Mugu Muyu, only thirty minutes from Tai Chang Elementary School. I spent a good thirty minutes perched atop a boulder, watching the water glide past.</p>

        <p>Some of the fifth grade students, visiting the English classroom during lunch period. Getting to teach the fun, bright, and curious students at Tai Chang was the highlight of my time in Taiwan, and the greatest honour of my life so far.</p>

        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm14.jpg">
        <p>Craggly Hehuanshan Peak, towering over 3,000 meters tall. I <a href = "./jctw.html">visited</a> during the Tomb Sweeping Day break in early April. The winding road through the mountains was completely covered in fog when I first got there; needless to say, driving through was a terrifying yet thrilling experience. On later days, like this one, the weather cleared up, revealing crisp and stunning views of central Taiwan.</p>

        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm18.jpg">
        <p>Over the spring, I helped out (along with Teacher Su Qiong, Teacher Clare, and Teacher Alex) in preparing the students for the Hualien English Singing Competition. They worked very hard and were awarded an 'A' grade for their performance of "A Little Love" by Fiona Fung.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "imagebox">
        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm15.jpg">
        <p>Shakadang Valley, especially lush in the spring. It became a familiar favourite for me during the year I spent in Hualien.</p>

      <div class = "imagebox">
        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm16.jpg">
        <p>One day after school, I spontaneously attempted to river trace the Shapodang River. A little bit dangerous in retrospect, but a small adventure that I still treasure. Afterwards I ate rice noodles at a newly-opened Vietnamese restaurant by my apartment.</p>

        <p>I was unbearably sad to say goodbye to my sixth graders, so I drowned my sorrows by scootering all the way to Yilan. The natural marvels there, like Tofu Cape, helped to soothe my troubled heart.</p>

        <p>Leaving school, for the last time. A place with so many great memories. If I go back, the building may be the same, but the students will be different -- the older ones will have graduated, the younger ones will have quickly grown up. There will never be another year like the one where I taught at Tai Chang.</p>

      <h3>In the Final Analysis</h3>
      <p>Well, what more is there really to say? It was a year that took me to many new and exciting places. I went all over Taiwan during the Chinese New Year's break in January and February, and then settled into Hualien for the second semester of school. In late February, March, April, I really hit my stride both as a teacher and as a foreigner living in Taiwan. I introduced more games, new types of homework assignments, and interactive speaking activities to the classroom, and the students (as well as my co-teacher and teaching advisor) responded positively. Speckled in there in April was an all-time great scooter trip to Hehuanshan. May and June, I will admit, my teaching was less successful; I got a little bit complacent, some of my new ideas flopped, and the sixth graders (eager for their graduation) became harder to motivate. Yet as far as the school year goes, the best was really saved for last. My students showed great improvement on the final exams. I was (and still am, even now) delighted and proud at the strides that they made, both in terms of shyer students becoming outstanding participants in class as well as students who were struggling at the beginning of the year working hard to push their exam scores into the 70s, 80s, and 90s.</p>
      <p>July and August were bridge months. July was a strange feeling, because I was still in Taiwan yet not a teacher anymore. In the beginning of the month, I did a flurry of traveling beyond Taiwan, going to Macau and then Sichuan. It feels proper that I went to Taiwan, so that I could see my family and visit the grave of my grandmother. And while in Sichuan, I always had the feeling that I was among one of the world's most influential and storied cultures. In the latter part of the month, I returned to cute little Taiwan, and said farewell to various places and people. Yet there were still new surprises and experiences there as well. It was really a storybook ending to a year that will always have a most special place in my heart. In August, I had to adjust to being back in the U.S. again, which was much harder than I expected. I went on a few nice trips with family, but to be honest my heart wasn't entirely in it; it was still in Taiwan. It was really great to see my family after so long, though; Taiwan sometimes felt a little bit lonely in this regard. At the end of the month I drove down south and set up shop in a cozy corner of the San Fernando Valley.</p>
      <p>The launch into my new job in September and October was a bit underwhelming. First, because I was still clearly feeling the wake of the excitement in Taiwan (and I still am). Second, because the office was a new, unfamiliar environment; it was humbling to be the new, inexperienced kid on the block, especially after commanding classrooms full of children in my previous stop. November, work picked up considerably, and in December I feel like I have gained my bearings a bit more. Some of the projects at work have been very interesting. So ultimately, the end of 2023 leaves me five months removed from a year of adventures abroad. It would be a lie to say that I'm ending the year at a peak; on some days I really wish that I was still in Taiwan. However, I think that in the past month or so I have begun to arrive at a place of quiet optimism for what lies ahead. The journey continues, and there are some exciting things in the works for 2024. And there are probably many more exciting things I can't yet foresee.</p>
