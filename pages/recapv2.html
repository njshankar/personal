      <h2>Let's end with a recap, Vol. II</h2>
      <p> The date is December 31st, and once again, it is time for a recap. </p>
      <h3>Early January</h3>
  <!--    <p> January began quietly. The weather in Hualien was crisp, and the end of the first semester at school was near. I looked on my secondary role in the third, fifth, and sixth grade classew with quiet frustration. On the other hand, with the fourth grade classes (which had a different co-teacher), I had taken more initiative to plan classroom activities. I took a proud sense of teacherly ownership in seeing my fourth graders' excitement at each English class, smiling and high-fiving me as they walked in the door, and becoming more and more confident with the vocabulary (the unit was on food!) with each passing day. This is why it was heartbreaking for me to be whisked away to the Fulbright mid-year conference just before final exams. Would they lose momentum without one of their teachers in the classroom to help them prepare?</p>
      <p> The conference itself was a low-point. It took place in a spa resort located in the middle of the mountains just south of Taipei City. The hotel grounds had many sculptures of dinosaurs, which was fun, I guess. But all the networking quickly wore me out and towards the end of the conference, I became as sick as a dog. </p> -->

        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/friend9.jpg">

        <p>On almost every Thursday night, I had dinner at the small Tai Chang Night Market. Many of my students, who lived in the area, would come with their parents to eat.</p>

        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm5.jpg">
        <p>Later, still during 2/28 break, I visited my good friend Anna in Keelung for one day, and fulfilled my cinephile dream of walking on the Zhongshan Bridge from <em>Milennium Mambo</em>.</p>

        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm6.jpg">

        <p>The view from Jiufen, which we visited for around thirty minutes. I really can't overstate how magical that day in Keelung was. The weather was sunny and bright, the sky and ocean bright blue.</p>

      <div class = "imagebox">
        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm9.jpg">
        <p>I went on some smaller adventures around Hualien in March. First up was Fuyuan National Forest, located in the south of the county.</p>

        <p>Driving along the Suhua Highway to Nan'an. The weather was perfect, the sea sparkling, and almost no one else was on the road.</p>

      <div class = "imagebox">
        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm12.jpg">
        <p>My first visit to the Mugu Muyu, only thirty minutes from Tai Chang Elementary School. I spent a good thirty minutes perched atop a boulder, watching the water glide past.</p>

        <p>Some of the fifth grade students, visiting the English classroom during lunch period. Getting to teach the fun, bright, and curious students at Tai Chang was the highlight of my time in Taiwan, and the greatest honour of my life so far.</p>

        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm14.jpg">
        <p>Craggly Hehuanshan Peak, towering over 3,000 meters tall. I <a href = "./jctw.html">visited</a> during the Tomb Sweeping Day break in early April. The winding road through the mountains was completely covered in fog when I first got there; needless to say, driving through was a terrifying yet thrilling experience. On later days, like this one, the weather cleared up, revealing crisp and stunning views of central Taiwan.</p>

      <div class = "imagebox">
        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm18.jpg">
        <p>Over the spring, I helped out (along with Teacher Su Qiong, Teacher Clare, and Teacher Alex) in preparing the students for the Hualien English Singing Competition. They worked very hard and were awarded an 'A' grade for their performance of "A Little Love" by Fiona Fung.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "imagebox">
        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm15.jpg">
        <p>Shakadang Valley, especially lush in the spring. It became a familiar favourite for me during the year I spent in Hualien.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "imagebox">
        <img src = "https://njshankar.github.io/personal/recap_pics/mm16.jpg">
        <p>One day after school, I spontaneously attempted to river trace the Shapodang River. A little bit dangerous in retrospect, but a small adventure that I still treasure. Afterwards I ate rice noodles at a newly-opened Vietnamese restaurant by my apartment.</p>
