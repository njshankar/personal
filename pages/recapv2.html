      <h2>Let's end with a recap, Vol. II</h2>
      <p> The date is December 31st, and once again, it is time for a recap. </p>
      <h3>January</h3>
  <!--    <p> January began quietly. The weather in Hualien was crisp, and the end of the first semester at school was near. I looked on my secondary role in the third, fifth, and sixth grade classew with quiet frustration. On the other hand, with the fourth grade classes (which had a different co-teacher), I had taken more initiative to plan classroom activities. I took a proud sense of teacherly ownership in seeing my fourth graders' excitement at each English class, smiling and high-fiving me as they walked in the door, and becoming more and more confident with the vocabulary (the unit was on food!) with each passing day. This is why it was heartbreaking for me to be whisked away to the Fulbright mid-year conference just before final exams. Would they lose momentum without one of their teachers in the classroom to help them prepare?</p>
      <p> The conference itself was a low-point. It took place in a spa resort located in the middle of the mountains just south of Taipei City. The hotel grounds had many sculptures of dinosaurs, which was fun, I guess. But all the networking quickly wore me out and towards the end of the conference, I became as sick as a dog. </p> -->
