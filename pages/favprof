      <h2>My Favorite Professors</h2>
      <p>Today is May 14, 2022. I'll be graduating from college tomorrow. One of the greatest aspects of my undergraduate time has been being able to learn from some exceptionally brilliant, dedicated, and caring professors. Here are five that I appreciate in particular: </p>
      <p>I can't begin with anyone other than <b> Prof. Goins</b>. I took two and a half classes with him. I studied linear algebra with him during my first semester at Pomona in Fall 2018. Coincidentally enough, this was also his first semester at Pomona; he'd moved from Purdue University the spring before. The class didn't start out very well for me. I had lacked confidence in my math abilities throughout high school. In the first week of Prof. Goins' class, my confidence took a further hit, as all of the abstract notation that he used and the proof problems that he assigned made me feel lost. My first homework assignment was returned, marked up in red pen. However, I stuck with the class, encouraged by professor's crisp lectures, the course mentor Eric, and my classmates, a few of which are among my closest friends to this day. </p>
      <p>I can't begin with anyone other than <b> Prof. Hudgings</b>. I took two and a half classes with Prof. Goins. I studied linear algebra with him during my first semester at Pomona in Fall 2018. Coincidentally enough, this was also his first semester at Pomona, as he'd moved from Purdue the spring before. I had lacked confidence in my math abilities throughout high school</p>
