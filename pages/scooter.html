      <p>It's been three weeks since I (rather dubiously) got my scooter license, and fifteen days since I rode my scooter out of the dealership lot. I have a Kymco Jockey 125cc, about ten years old. I have no idea if that's a good model or not (my LET told me that Kymco is one of the two largest scooter brands in Taiwan), nor whether the $29,000 NTD I paid for it is a fair price. But it's irrevocably altered my life in Taiwan. When I look back on my two months here, there's before scooter, and after scooter. The line separating them is very clear. </p>
      <p>Having a scooter has unlocked new places, new adventures. The day after I got my scooter, I rode it around my school's surroundings -- the university campus on one side of the main road, the indigenous village on the other, the rice farms to the east. Such a simple act, which took all of fifteen minutes, afforded me a richer perspective on the life of my students. I've taken my scooter for random trips to the mountains, and to Taroko National Park both days last weekend. Similar to an open-world video game, it feels as if having a scoooter has lifted the fog on the map. When I had just arrived in Taiwan, I could only walk, and the accessible territory was the few blocks surrounding my apartment. Then, a few weeks later, my LET lended me his sons's bicycle; the accessible territory thus expanded to a few square kilometers. Now, with a scooter, it truly seems as if the accessible territiory is all of Taiwan! I hope to build up my riding endurance, and perhaps take a trip around the island during the New Year's break.</p>
      <p>There's a flip side, though. Simultaneous to stretching the lands that are explorable to me, having a scooter vastly contracts the landscapes that I was hitherto able to explore. This is quite peculiar. The city of Hualien feels tiny now. I remember, on the third day out of quarantine, when I was meeting some friends at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant for lunch. I had to walk 20 minutes in the mid-day sun, and I felt like I was about to faint. Now, I can ride across the entire city in fewer than ten minutes.  </p>
