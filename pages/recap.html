      <p>My last attempt to summarize my time in Taiwan was very cringey. I shall do better this time. </p>
      <p> The date is December 31st, 2022. It has been a strange year. Many changes have taken place. The Weeknd's <em>Dawn FM</em> still slaps (how did "Less Than Zero" not even crack the top 40?), but I am no longer a college student. The spring semester was interesting. I put some unprofitable relationships in the rear-view mirror; as unprofitable as they were, they were difficult to let go of. I found greater joy in some older relationships, as well as some newer ones in the Asian-American Resource Center, and in my church. I learned how to play poker (my first time playing, I won on the river with a 2-7). With a car, I finally got to see some of Los Angeles (Pasadena, Riverside, Palos Verdes, Signal Hill, J-Tree). And I saw Twice (it still feels like a dream)!!!! I had fun in my classes, like Melnick's very chill Comp Ling class, Harmonic Analysis with Prof. O (and Sunday p-set sessions with Jiahui), and Prof. Park's senior-heavy East Asia Ethnography & Film (it was kind of a meme, but now it is unironically one of my favorites from college). With one foot out the door, dealing with a few messy feelings, and afflicted with a mild case of senioritis, I was in a bit of a funky headspace throughout the spring. It wasn't my best semester academically but thanks to a mad dash in pre-finals week I pulled out all A's. I gave a knockout thesis presentation, but admittedly kind of mailed it in on thesis itself (still got department honors though). I graduated with summa, that was fun. I'm thankful for all the kind professors who helped me in my journey, and the classmates who made me feel more whole. </p>
