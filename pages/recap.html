      <h2>Let's end with a recap</h2>
      <p>My last attempt to summarize my time in Taiwan was very cringey. I shall do better this time. </p>
      <p> The date is December 31st, 2022. It has been a strange year. Many changes have taken place. The Weeknd's <em>Dawn FM</em> still slaps (how did "Less Than Zero" not even crack the top 40?), but I am no longer a college student. The spring semester was interesting. I put some unprofitable relationships in the rear-view mirror; as unprofitable as they were, they were difficult to let go of. I found greater joy in some older relationships, as well as some newer ones in the Asian-American Resource Center, and in my church. I learned how to play poker (my first time playing, I won on the river with a 2-7). With a car, I finally got to see some of Los Angeles (Pasadena, Riverside, LACMA, Palos Verdes, Signal Hill, J-Tree, a play about the Lehman brothers). And I saw Twice (it still feels like a dream)!!!! I had fun in my classes, like Melnick's very chill Comp Ling class, Harmonic Analysis with Prof. O (and Sunday p-set sessions with Jiahui), and Prof. Park's senior-heavy East Asia Ethnography & Film (it was kind of a meme, but now it is unironically one of my favorites from college). With one foot out the door, dealing with a few messy feelings, and afflicted with a mild case of senioritis, I was in a bit of a funky headspace throughout the spring. It wasn't my best semester academically but thanks to a mad dash in pre-finals week I pulled out all A's. I gave a knockout thesis presentation, but admittedly kind of mailed it in on thesis itself (still got department honors though). I graduated with summa, that was fun. I'm thankful for all the kind professors who helped me in my journey, and the classmates who made me feel more whole. </p>

      <p> As if leaving college and the relationships therein behind weren't enough, the summer brought greater changes. I spent most of my time milling about our attic, reading books (my favorites being Mann's <em>Magic Mountain</em> and Bolano's <em>Savage Detectives</em>) and helping my mom pack boxes for the move out of my childhood home. Slowly but surely, all the drawers were emptied out, the bookshelves cleared of their books, the tools moved out of the garage. Things got a bit tense towards the end, as we tried to reduce the amount of boxes and avoid additional charges from the moving company. The sheer amount of junk we had accumulated over the years was really quite eye-opening! A two-day trip to see some old schoolmates in Madison was a refreshing break. It was fun to watch <em>Buffy</em> with dad. So was chilling with the new puppy Pocket. At first she would bark loudly every time I entered the room, but I like to think that by summer's end we became good friends. Still, saying goodbye to my childhood town and my childhood home made me a little sad. Losing my grandmother made me very sad. She was the person who inspired me most in life. I always knew I'd one day have to go on without her, but even several months later, it doesn't quite feel right.</p>
