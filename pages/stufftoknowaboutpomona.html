      <p>I'm currently in my sixth semester at Pomona College. While I don't confess to knowing all of the ins-and-outs of the school and the greater Claremont Consortium, I'll list some of my thoughts on the school, and how they've changed during my time here.</p>
      <p>One of the main draws of Pomona for me was its location. As someone who had lived in the boring, flat state of Illinois for my entire life, spending four years in SoCal, with its palm trees, glitz, and Mediterranean climate, was a highly alluring prospect, and enough to make me eschew my state school down in Champaign. </p>
      <p>I'd say that in this manner, Pomona has mostly lived up to my expectations. The weather in Claremont gets to be scorching hot during the summer months, which makes for a sticky first few weeks of the fall semester. It certainly helps to live in a dorm with air conditioning (I lived in Mudd-Blaisdell during my freshman year, and Oldenborg during my second year), and by mid-September, the daytime temperatures settle into a nice 50s-60s range. At night, the temperature can cool quickly (and even become cold for a northerner like me), so it's wise to plan accordingly. </p>
      <p>Theoretically, the Claremont Consortium also offers pretty easy access to the SoCal attractions and amenities, but in practice, getting to Los Angeles is a bit of a hassle. There's a Metrolink stop two minutes away from South Campus, and an hour-long ride ($10 round trip, if I remember correctly) gets you to Union Station. Downtown, Chinatown, and Japantown are all within walking distance of Union, which is nice. I'm not the type of person who ventures out every weekend (some people do), but I've made it out to K-Town, Monterey Park, Staples Center, The Huntington Library, etc.</p>
      <p>However, accessing other places within the city (i.e. UCLA, Venice, Santa Monica), as well as nearby towns (like Pasadena) from Claremont is difficult given the LA sprawl and limited public transportation network -- a car is pretty much a necessity for this. The Claremont campus is home to a couple of Zipcar lots, but these get to be very expensive, and are much better for a quick run to the nearby Target in Montclair than, say, a day trip to Santa Monica. </p>
      <p>Two things about the academic experience that Pomona really likes to sell are 1) the Claremont Consortium and 2) small classes, and when I was entering the school, I was pretty excited about these. In retrospect, it would have been nice to have a bit of a fuller picture, which I'll attempt to provide here. The Claremont Consortium is, well, a bit of a lie. True, it's wonderful to be able to meet people from the other schools, to eat at their dining halls, and to sneak around their buildings late at night. But if you're hoping to benefit as a Pomona student from classes at Harvey Mudd's famed CS department or Claremont McKenna's powerhouse econ/finance department, you'll have a bit of a tough go at it, as students from outside these respective schools generally aren't allowed into such classes. With math and humanities classes, things generally seem to be more open. So far, I've taken 3 classes at Harvey Mudd, 1 class at CMC, and 1 class at CGU.</p>
      <p>Also, small classes are indeed great .... but only if you can get into them, which is not easy, especially as a freshman or sophomore. Course registration in these first two years is unwelcomingly suspenseful. Expect to not get into at least 1 or 2 of your top choices. Seminars taught by the most popular professors fill up FAST. Forget about taking CS classes at the 5C's unless you're willing to commit to the major. Another thing that might be good to know is that at a small liberal arts college, many classes aren't offered very frequently. For instance, in my experience, I've found that many middle and upper-division math and economic classes that would be offered every semester at a larger university are only available once every other semester, or even once every two years. There's always going to be something interesting offered, regardless of the semester, but it might not be exactly what you want, unless you plan carefully. </p>
      <p>One of the more frustrating things for me about Pomona College is grade inflation: it's rampant. For instance, the top quarter of students in each class has a perfect 12.000 GPA. Some of this might reflect the supportiveness of the academic environment here (professors really want students to succeed), as well as the high caliber of the students, but an oversaturation of A's doesn't help anyone. I say this as one of those students with a 12.000 GPA. One of the things I love about Pomona students is that they're incredibly down to earth and not out to compete with one another, but when the average school GPA is so high, it creates a great deal of stress, impostor syndrome, and undue attention to keeping up grades among students, especially for those with perfectionist tendencies (of which there are a great deal here).  </p>
      <p>Overall, despite some of these complaints, the Claremont Colleges are home (in a non-COVID world, at least) to some of the most amazing people in the world. I've had 1 or 2 less than inspiring instructors, but the overwhelming share of professors not only want to be here, but to teach here, because teaching comes with the territory. I can name several examples, just within the math department. The professor whom I studied Linear Algebra with during my first semester in 2018 was, like me, a newcomer to Pomona -- he had just left his position as a full professor at a Research I university because he relished the diversity of students and more personalized instruction that Claremont had to offer. The following semester, I took Differential Equations with the president of the Association for Women in Mathematics. This semester, I'm studying with one of the top applied topologists in the world, who also happens to be a god-tier teacher. The density of flat-out genius students in Claremont is surely lower than that in the Ivies or down the road at CalTech, but everyone here is interesting, and has something that they are truly passionate about. Students here want each other to succeed, not just academically, but socially, emotionally, and spiritually, and since it's a smaller school, the people that you pass by on your way to class each day are people that you actually know. I can't wait to get back to campus next fall!</p>
