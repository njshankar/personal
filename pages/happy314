      <p>The smell of Indomie bubbling in the kettle at 11 pm.</p>
      <p>Mom tells me she had another strange dream about grandmom. She wants me to interpret it for her like Joseph.</p>
      <p>The notes of the Ravel piece emanating from underneath my fingertips. Now it's actually starting to sound like the recordings do.</p>
      <p>My friend sends me pictures of her Austin trip at 12:24 am. </p>
      <p>The Illini, who have given me so much hope over this turbulent season. I don't even care if they win tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The idea for problem two on the real analysis problem set comes to me as I'm doing the dishes.</p>
      <p>Watching K-pop videos before bedtime.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Columbo.</p>
      <p>Writing about things that make me happy.</p>
