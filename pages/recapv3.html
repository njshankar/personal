      <h2>Let's end with a recap, Vol. III</h2>
      <p> It is December 2024, and once again, it is time for a recap. </p>
      <h3>Springtime Adventures</h3>
      <p>I entered the year energized and ready to see more places around Los Angeles. The winter was very rainy, making spring a great opportunity to experience some of Southern California's rivers and waterfalls. Each weekend I tried to go out and see at least one new and cool place, and I think I largely succeeded.</p>

      <h3>Lull in February</h3>
      <p>Early in the year, I also settled more into my new job (which I started in September 2023). I got on some interesting projects and it felt good to make contributions that my managers valued. In mid-February, however, a couple of my projects abruptly closed. I felt discouraged at first, but looking back, this was a great chance to recharge for the months to come.</p>
      <p>I went to the Little Tokyo Library and checked out <em>All the Strangers in the Night</em> by Mieko Kawakami. I enjoyed the simple writing and found myself drawn to the lonesome main character. I also enjoyed going to the Noho Laemmle on back-to-back weekday afternoons to see <em>The Taste of Things</em> and <em>Perfect Days</em>.  Watching these two meditative movies in a nearly-empty theater was a perfect way to unwind. By Thursday the following week, I was staffed to a large project that lasted me until September.</p>
        <!--    <p> January began quietly. The weather in Hualien was crisp, and the end of the first semester at school was near. I looked on my secondary role in the third, fifth, and sixth grade classew with quiet frustration. On the other hand, with the fourth grade classes (which had a different co-teacher), I had taken more initiative to plan classroom activities. I took a proud sense of teacherly ownership in seeing my fourth graders' excitement at each English class, smiling and high-fiving me as they walked in the door, and becoming more and more confident with the vocabulary (the unit was on food!) with each passing day. This is why it was heartbreaking for me to be whisked away to the Fulbright mid-year conference just before final exams. Would they lose momentum without one of their teachers in the classroom to help them prepare?</p>
      <p> The conference itself was a low-point. It took place in a spa resort located in the middle of the mountains just south of Taipei City. The hotel grounds had many sculptures of dinosaurs, which was fun, I guess. But all the networking quickly wore me out and towards the end of the conference, I became as sick as a dog. </p> -->
      <h3>Elephant Gym</h3>
      <p>One of my favorite days of the year was March 9th, when I saw the band Elephant Gym play. That morning, I went on a nice solo hike in Pacific Palisades, had lunch at my favorite ramen restaurant in Sawtelle, and spent the afternoon reading books at the Beverly Hills library. In the evening I took stroll around The Grove, and was dazzled by the bright lights and fountains. And the concert itself was incredible. The band members were very friendly and down-to-earth, and you could tell how much they loved the music by the way they played. I'm so thankful that they came all the way from Kaoshuing, Taiwan to share their joyful music. It was one of those moments that felt like a dream.</p>

      <p>The rest of the spring, I was in the office a lot. But there were relaxing moments too. I took some nice walks to Little Tokyo after work, or to Grand Central Market to get dinner. I became quite familiar with Downtown LA too. And one Saturday in April, I completed my Bible study homework at the Manhattan Beach Library and saw Herbie Hancock perform at Walt Disney in the evening. A couple days later, I finished reading <em>A Suitable Boy</em> (it only took me five months).</p>

      <h3>Chaotic May</h3>
      <p>May was a big month for me. I moved to a new apartment near beautiful Echo Park. I got a new phone. Also, with some big project deadlines, things got pretty helter skelter at work. Thankfully, my mom was there to help me weather the storm. She visited for a week around Mother's Day, helping me to arrange my furniture, settle into my new place, and to cook some delicious food. We also got to see the amazing pianist Yuja Wang play Chopin's Ballads (and 7 encore pieces) at Walt Disney Hall. </p>
      <p>Early that month, I also wrote some graduation letters to students in Taiwan that I had taught the previous year. It was tiring (and expensive) to write so many cards by hand and mail them off, but it was enjoyable in that I got to remember all of these amazing students. An extremely kind man at a shop in Burbank gave me some free packs of basketball cards to pass along to the boys, which made me feel so touched. In Taiwan, my former co-teacher Alex helped give the letters out to the students, and to my surprise I received many wonderful thank-you emails from them.</p>

      <p>In early June, I visited my family in Sacramento. It was a peaceful week-long stay. After I came back to Los Angeles, I studied very hard for my CFA exam. Each weekend I would go to a new library in the LA area to study. Like my earlier stay at mom's house, the summer passed peacefully, with little fanfare.</p>

      <h3>Peaceful Stay in the Bay</h3>
      <p>August 24th was a turning point in my year. That morning, I took my exam. The staff at the testing center were very friendly, and I felt good about the result as I walked out. Afterwards, I took a leisurely drive around the Santa Monica Mountains, stopping over at the Calabasas Commons (because I always love myself a Rick Caruso shopping center). The next day, I drove back up to Northern California.</p>
      <p>I stayed with my mom for the first week in Sacramento and then my brother for the second in the Bay. It was very peaceful to stay in my brother's spacious university apartment. He introduced me to his record collection, and we went to a few fine restaurants in the East Bay. I also had a nice solo morning at the Presidio in San Francisco, and I spent a happy afternoon with my good friend from school.</p>

      <p>The fall was a great time too. With the exam monkey off my back, I really got the chance to settle into my new apartment and into a nice work-life balance. Along the way, I enjoyed many magnificent books, like <em>Grotesque</em>, <em>Trust</em>, <em>My Brilliant Friend</em>, and <em>The Water Margin</em> and visited many magnificent places around LA.</p>

      <h3>Journey to Asia</h3>
      <p>In November and December, I went to Asia. I first spent some time in Taiwan, where I enjoyed a few days in Taipei and visited Hualien again. It felt great to be welcomed back after a year-and-a-half away. I was happy to see my former students learning so well. Some of them even remembered me. I had a wonderful dinner with my co-teacher and head teacher (now retired, and living in a Buddhist hall) from that year. The new English teachers at the school welcomed me with open arms.</p>
      <p>From Taiwan, I went to Macau where I attended my cousin Ariel's wedding. I saw many of my aunts and uncles at the wedding banquet. The following Monday I went with my mom, brother, and stepfather to visit the grave of my grandparents, high up on the hill overlooking the river. The days passed quickly and I felt disoriented in the moment, but I know those days were special. I might not visit Macau too many more times in the future.</p>
      <p>After Macau I went to Hong Kong. When I was younger, I went to Hong Kong many times on the way to Macau, but never for very long. This time, though, I stayed there for three days, and was satisfied to finally get a better sense of the place.</p>
      <p>I spent the last week in mainland China. I was very impressed by the modern cities there, like Shenzhen, as well as the incredible subways and high-speed rail networks, the clean and orderly streets, and above all, kind and hard-working people everywhere you go. At the same time, I got to experience some amazing world heritage sites like the ancient city of Quanzhou, the serene Wuyishan National Park, and the famous old trading post of Kulangyu Island.</p>
      <p>I closed out my travels with a quick run through Kinmen and Taipei. </p>
      <h3>In the Final Analysis</h3>
      <p>Well, what more is there really to say? It was a year that took me to many new and exciting places. I went all over Taiwan during the Chinese New Year's break in January and February, and then settled into Hualien for the second semester of school. In late February, March, April, I really hit my stride both as a teacher and as a foreigner living in Taiwan. I introduced more games, new types of homework assignments, and interactive speaking activities to the classroom, and the students (as well as my co-teacher and teaching advisor) responded positively. Speckled in there in April was an all-time great scooter trip to Hehuanshan. May and June, I will admit, my teaching was less successful; I got a little bit complacent, some of my new ideas flopped, and the sixth graders (eager for their graduation) became harder to motivate. Yet as far as the school year goes, the best was really saved for last. My students showed great improvement on the final exams. I was (and still am, even now) delighted and proud at the strides that they made, both in terms of shyer students becoming outstanding participants in class as well as students who were struggling at the beginning of the year working hard to push their exam scores into the 70s, 80s, and 90s.</p>
      <p>July and August were bridge months. July was a strange feeling, because I was still in Taiwan yet not a teacher anymore. In the beginning of the month, I did a flurry of traveling beyond Taiwan, going to Macau and then Sichuan. It feels proper that I went to Taiwan, so that I could see my family and visit the grave of my grandmother. And while in Sichuan, I always had the feeling that I was among one of the world's most influential and storied cultures. In the latter part of the month, I returned to cute little Taiwan, and said farewell to various places and people. Yet there were still new surprises and experiences there as well. It was really a storybook ending to a year that will always have a most special place in my heart. In August, I had to adjust to being back in the U.S. again, which was much harder than I expected. I went on a few nice trips with family, but to be honest my heart wasn't entirely in it; it was still in Taiwan. It was really great to see my family after so long, though; Taiwan sometimes felt a little bit lonely in this regard. At the end of the month I drove down south and set up shop in a cozy corner of the San Fernando Valley.</p>
      <p>The launch into my new job in September and October was a bit underwhelming. First, because I was still clearly feeling the wake of the excitement in Taiwan (and I still am). Second, because the office was a new, unfamiliar environment; it was humbling to be the new, inexperienced kid on the block, especially after commanding classrooms full of children in my previous stop. November, work picked up considerably, and in December I feel like I have gained my bearings a bit more. Some of the projects at work have been very interesting. So ultimately, the end of 2023 leaves me five months removed from a year of adventures abroad. It would be a lie to say that I'm ending the year at a peak; on some days I really wish that I was still in Taiwan. However, I think that in the past month or so I have begun to arrive at a place of quiet optimism for what lies ahead. The journey continues, and there are some exciting things in the works for 2024. And there are probably many more exciting things I can't yet foresee.</p>
