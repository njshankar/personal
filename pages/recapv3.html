      <h2>Let's end with a recap, Vol. III</h2>
      <p> It is December 2024, and once again, it is time for a recap. </p>
      <h3>Springtime Adventures</h3>
      <p>I entered the year energized and ready to see more places around Los Angeles. The winter was very rainy, making spring a great opportunity to experience some of Southern California's rivers and waterfalls. Each weekend I tried to go out and see at least one new and cool place, and I think I largely succeeded.</p>

      <h3>Lull in February</h3>
      <p>Early in the year, I also settled more into my new job (which I started in September 2023). I got on some interesting projects and it felt good to make contributions that my managers valued. In mid-February, however, a couple of my projects abruptly closed. I felt discouraged at first, but looking back, this was a great chance to recharge for the months to come.</p>
      <p>I went to the Little Tokyo Library and checked out <em>All the Strangers in the Night</em> by Mieko Kawakami. I enjoyed the simple writing and found myself drawn to the lonesome main character. I also enjoyed going to the Noho Laemmle on back-to-back weekday afternoons to see <em>The Taste of Things</em> and <em>Perfect Days.  Watching these two meditative movies in a nearly-empty theater was a perfect way to unwind. By Thursday the following week, I was staffed to a large project that lasted me until September.</em>.
        <!--    <p> January began quietly. The weather in Hualien was crisp, and the end of the first semester at school was near. I looked on my secondary role in the third, fifth, and sixth grade classew with quiet frustration. On the other hand, with the fourth grade classes (which had a different co-teacher), I had taken more initiative to plan classroom activities. I took a proud sense of teacherly ownership in seeing my fourth graders' excitement at each English class, smiling and high-fiving me as they walked in the door, and becoming more and more confident with the vocabulary (the unit was on food!) with each passing day. This is why it was heartbreaking for me to be whisked away to the Fulbright mid-year conference just before final exams. Would they lose momentum without one of their teachers in the classroom to help them prepare?</p>
      <p> The conference itself was a low-point. It took place in a spa resort located in the middle of the mountains just south of Taipei City. The hotel grounds had many sculptures of dinosaurs, which was fun, I guess. But all the networking quickly wore me out and towards the end of the conference, I became as sick as a dog. </p> -->
      <h3>Elephant Gym</h3>
      <p>One of my favorite days of the year was March 9th, when I saw the band Elephant Gym play. That morning, I went on a nice solo hike in Pacific Palisades, had lunch at my favorite ramen restaurant in Sawtelle, and spent the afternoon reading books at the Beverly Hills library. In the evening I took stroll around The Grove, and was dazzled by the bright lights and fountains. And the concert itself was incredible. The band members were very friendly and down-to-earth, and you could tell how much they loved the music by the way they played. I'm so thankful that they came all the way from Kaoshuing, Taiwan to share their joyful music. It was one of those moments that felt like a dream.</em>.

      <h3>Chaotic May</h3>
      <h3>Peaceful Stay in the Bay</h3>
      <h3>Journey to Asia</h3>
      <h3>In the Final Analysis</h3>
      <p>Well, what more is there really to say? It was a year that took me to many new and exciting places. I went all over Taiwan during the Chinese New Year's break in January and February, and then settled into Hualien for the second semester of school. In late February, March, April, I really hit my stride both as a teacher and as a foreigner living in Taiwan. I introduced more games, new types of homework assignments, and interactive speaking activities to the classroom, and the students (as well as my co-teacher and teaching advisor) responded positively. Speckled in there in April was an all-time great scooter trip to Hehuanshan. May and June, I will admit, my teaching was less successful; I got a little bit complacent, some of my new ideas flopped, and the sixth graders (eager for their graduation) became harder to motivate. Yet as far as the school year goes, the best was really saved for last. My students showed great improvement on the final exams. I was (and still am, even now) delighted and proud at the strides that they made, both in terms of shyer students becoming outstanding participants in class as well as students who were struggling at the beginning of the year working hard to push their exam scores into the 70s, 80s, and 90s.</p>
      <p>July and August were bridge months. July was a strange feeling, because I was still in Taiwan yet not a teacher anymore. In the beginning of the month, I did a flurry of traveling beyond Taiwan, going to Macau and then Sichuan. It feels proper that I went to Taiwan, so that I could see my family and visit the grave of my grandmother. And while in Sichuan, I always had the feeling that I was among one of the world's most influential and storied cultures. In the latter part of the month, I returned to cute little Taiwan, and said farewell to various places and people. Yet there were still new surprises and experiences there as well. It was really a storybook ending to a year that will always have a most special place in my heart. In August, I had to adjust to being back in the U.S. again, which was much harder than I expected. I went on a few nice trips with family, but to be honest my heart wasn't entirely in it; it was still in Taiwan. It was really great to see my family after so long, though; Taiwan sometimes felt a little bit lonely in this regard. At the end of the month I drove down south and set up shop in a cozy corner of the San Fernando Valley.</p>
      <p>The launch into my new job in September and October was a bit underwhelming. First, because I was still clearly feeling the wake of the excitement in Taiwan (and I still am). Second, because the office was a new, unfamiliar environment; it was humbling to be the new, inexperienced kid on the block, especially after commanding classrooms full of children in my previous stop. November, work picked up considerably, and in December I feel like I have gained my bearings a bit more. Some of the projects at work have been very interesting. So ultimately, the end of 2023 leaves me five months removed from a year of adventures abroad. It would be a lie to say that I'm ending the year at a peak; on some days I really wish that I was still in Taiwan. However, I think that in the past month or so I have begun to arrive at a place of quiet optimism for what lies ahead. The journey continues, and there are some exciting things in the works for 2024. And there are probably many more exciting things I can't yet foresee.</p>
