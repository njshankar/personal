      <p>This note will be short. I've been thinking about my time in high school lately. Not sure why. It mostly feels like a blur. I kept my grades up, my profile low. Friends came and went. I passed lunch periods in the study center and science classroom. Chugging along, day after day, not thinking much of my self, or about anything at all. Other students, they formed cliques, won awards, went to parties, took drugs, had drama. Me, I always went home as soon as I could. Finish homework promptly (if not at school), and wither away the remaining hours in an off-hand way. Looking back, I think I treated those four years as a phase to hurry past as fast as I could. I never took the time to live in the moment, or actually learn...</p>
      <p>But what I actually want to talk about is the martial arts class I took in fall of my junior year. Ah, Mr. Villanueva. A stocky Filipino dude, tough as nails. He failed me on the kickbocking exam when I missed the bag altogether on a roundhouse kick. But actually, he was a pretty nice guy. One of those teachers who tries not to just be a teacher of a subject, but a teacher of life. At the end of each class, he would round us all up in a circle. He'd give us a pep talk, and clap his hands to break up the huddle, just like a coach would. One time, he called us his "employees" and himself our "employer." That rubbed me the wrong way for some reason. Another time, he urged us to embark on the "silent drive challenge." To drive to school in silence, without turning on the radio. He framed it as something that would change our lives. But as someone who was not among the car-driving population of students, I couldn't really understand what he meant. I do now. </p>
      <p>He'd lead us through a move, such as the jab or hook punch, maybe seven or eight times. Before the final time, he'd make us chant "last one, best one!" I always thought that was a little bit corny. As if saying those words would magically allow us to end on a high note. With another chapter in my life ending this week, those words -- "last one, best one" -- have been ringing around my mind. And it seems to me like so often, the last one isn't actually the best one at all. </p>
      <p>I played this same game only one year ago. The ending of my college years was messy, topsy-turvy. Not much of a big bowtie at all. Little fanfare, graduate and skip town the next day. Now, I find things happening with similarly little fanfare. I attended the sixth graders' graduation ceremony last week. From a teacher's perspective, at least, there were no tearful goodbyes, no impassioned thank-you's, no warm hugs. Just a collective wave from the stage, the "bai bai" of Jay Chou's voice, students jamming rose bouquets down my shirt, and that's it, goodbye forever. </p>
      <p>This morning, as it was their last English period of the year, I tried to give a more thoughtful goodbye to my 5B class. I prepared a little speech, where I gave a little shout out to each student. Met mostly with shrugs and inattentive eyes. Then I did an activity where I challenged each student to say a unique word or phrase that they learned in English class this year in exchange for a piece of candy. That whipped the class to life. If there's one thing I've learned this year, nothing motivates kids like candy. It was genuinely satisfying to hear the students shout out all the different things they remembered from class, like "couch potato" or "science" or "rose" or "MRT" or "piece of cake" or "walk the dog" or "gym" (contributed by the student named Jim). But then, when it was time to wave goodbye forever, not much of a pause. Just the same silly questions, like "when are you going to find a girlfriend?" or "where do you live in the USA?" or "can I add you on Facebook?". The boy named Charles said he'd track me down in L.A. so we could go to a Lakers game together. The half-caucasian girl named Tavia tried to add me on LINE, but I couldn't find my username. The unruly boy named Alan stayed for a bit after class to sit in my swivel chair and proclaimed "I am AI." A very Daft Punk thing to say. That brought a smile to my face. </p>
      <p>And there are more goodbyes to come in the coming days. I wonder how those will shake out. If the last year and the last week have taught me anything, it's not to expect too much. No neat little bowties, no outpourings of emotion. The last one is seldom the best one, except maybe in Mr. Villanueva's martial arts class. </p>
