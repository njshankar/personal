      <h2>Winter travels</h2>
      <p>I rarely left Hualien last year, except to attend Fulbright conferences in Taipei. Part of it was laziness, part of it contentment to remain tucked away in Taiwan's beautiful backyard.</p>
      <p>That all changed with winter break. After a weekend that included a big New Year's feast at my co-teacher's parent's household, I set out for Taitung by scooter, first by way of Highway 193, which runs alongside Farglory Mountain, and then cutting east towards Highway 11. Even though I've become quite familiar with the coastal highway by now, I still had the chance to stop by some new places, like Jinzunyou Lookout, as well as the beautiful Donghe Bridge, reminiscent of its bigger cousin in Changhong. That night in Taitung, I met up with my Hualien housemate Nick at Star Tribe, a coffeehouse on top of a large mountain overlooking the city. That night was also my first time staying at a hostel. I met some friendly people in the middle of their huandao trip.</p>
      <p>The next day, after enjoying the large breakfast buffet at my hostel, I set off for Kenting. Along the way, I stopped at the peaceful Zhiben Forest Park, taking in the forest bath trail there. Back onto Highway 11, I pulled over at the Duoliang Railway Station to watch trains run along the ocean. The place was quite busy. A guitarist strummed "Yong Bao" by Mayday, which, in combination with the ocean, called to mind a scene from <em>Someday or One Day</em>. Peaceful afternoon vibes. Later that afternoon, I illegally traversed the Caopu Tunnel. It was fun while it lasted but resulted in a $900 fine. My hotel in Nanwan, Kenting was much nicer than the one in Pingtung, a capsule-style place with tasteful decorations, immaculately-clean bathrooms, and a top-floor lounge offering ocean views and a fridge fully stocked with freshly-made, complimentary drinks. Over the course of my three-night stay, I must have helped myself to at least ten cups of their winter gourd tea. </p>
      <p>The following morning was overcast. My first stop was a quick tour of the Kenting National Park Visitor Center. A friendly volunteer walked me around each of the exhibits. I didn't understand much of what she was saying but kept nodding anyways. How sad. I then went to the Kenting National Forest and the adjacent Sheding Park, taking in the coral rock formations and seeing a fun rainbow. There were so many families out vacationing for the holidays, which I must admit made feel a little bit lonely as a solo traveller. That afternoon I took a stroll around Eluanbi, and stood in the southernmost point of Taiwan (the island, not the country). Dinner was first at a thai restaurant, and then (because my first dinner hadn't satiated me fully) the bustling Kenting night market. It was quite striking to see the road gradually overtaken by night market pedestrians, so much so that the police eventually closed the road to cars. </p>
      <p>Day two in Kenting, I rode in the other direction, hitting Maobitou, walking atop the historic walls of Hengchun, and then riding to the other side of the national park to take a walk along the rocky shores of Jialeshui. At this last stop, I got badly sunburned, but as a consolation prize, I had some very good ice cream at Gangkou. For dinner, I patronized the Kenting night market once more. I took my food back to the hotel, parking myself in one of the lounge's cozy sofas. After a few minutes, a man named Kenjy, from Taizhong, plopped down next to me. He shared some of his Japanese beers and we had a friendly conversation while the rest of his wife and teenage kids punched away on their smartphones. Kenjy, quite familiar with the East Coast, recommended some good water spots in Hualien. After feeling alone in my travels, I felt a much welcome sense of company. </p>
      <p>I left rather early the next day and went to Pingtung to meet Ashley Cheng. My anti-social mind was rather apprehensive about meeting her, but I enjoyed that afternoon very much. It was wonderful to see an American friend after so long, and she (and/or her grandma) treated me to some delicious curry rice at a cute bakery cafe. She then took me (or rather, I took her, very sketchily as the first passenger I have ever driven on my scooter) to the Pacific Department Store, where we played at the arcade, and Pingtung Park, where we climbed up the bleachers of the track-and-field stadium. We parted ways around 4PM, and I rode over to Meinong. As I was riding, my phone died. As luck would have it, I hadn't memorized the name or address of my homestay for the night. In the sunset hours, I had to ride around the rice fields frantically, stopping to ask random farmers for directions I only partially understood. Eventually, one farmer escorted me to a homestay towards the center of town. It turned out to not be my homestay, but the owner let me juice up my phone a little bit. Once I could open my booking email, she called up the owner of the right homestay to escort me over. The homestay turned out to be very interesting. It was a large mansion, tucked away under a grove of trees. The place reminded me of some family manor out of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> or a similar tale. My room was very simple yet comfortable. That night, I took a stroll around the duck pond and called mom. I drank a little bit too much of the complementary tea, so I had trouble falling asleep. I had something of an out-of-body experience in bed. </p>
      <p>The next morning, I woke up early again and had some homecooked breakfast in the main hall of the mansion. The breakfast was simple -- an egg sandwich, hot soymilk, and a few slices of fruit -- but brought me much joy. Then I began my long journey back to the east. That morning, the skies were perfectly clear over the mountainous eastern districts of Kaohsuing. I stopped over in a cute little village named Taoyuan for some roadside toast and stinky tofu. Shortly afterwards, I entered Yushan National Park, and the road became very very steep. It just kept climbing and climbing. After a bit, I stopped by a vista point. There was a coffee stand along the ledge of the cliff, and a cute pair of little Bunun sisters dancing to Tiktok remixes of "You Exist in My Song" by Wanting Qu and "In the End" by Linkin Park. I enjoyed the view, and set out to leave, but my scooter wouldn't start. I had been dreading this all along. I felt so helpless in that instant. I also had to pee. So I went to the porta potty and sprayed to my heart's content. I walked out and tried my scooter again. It started! I was so happy. The highway subsequently kept on climbing, and the roadside views looked good, but I was too afraid to make any further stops. At some point, the road crossed over into the realm of the clouds, which made me feel very cold. Traffic came to a halt to let cars pass in the other direction. It must have been at least 15 or minutes or so before traffic started again. I crept along the mist-shrouded road, and into an old, one-lane tunnel. To my astonishment, I came out of the other end to perfectly clear blue skies. Forget my scooter problems, I had to stop here. This place, I found out, was Yakou pass, and it overlooked a great sea of clouds. I didn't linger for too long, as the place was crawling with traffic. The road dipped slowly into the belly of the sea of clouds. I could barely see three feet ahead of me. The bearded moss trees by the side of the road looked like intricate ice sculptures. My fingers and toes felt frigid like nobody's business. Just as the road had kept climbing and climbing before the tunnel, now the road kept going down and down and down. The sea of clouds seemed interminable. I must have rode through it for close to two hours. Eventually, it came to an end, and I hightailed it as fast as I could to my hotel in Chishang, my coldness causing me to ignore the Taroko-esque gorges I passed along the way. I reached the hotel around 6 or so. The owner was very friendly. She showed me to my room, and I immediately burrowed under the covers. I was lucky to not get frostbites that day. I napped for an hour, and grabbed a modest dinner at the Saturday Chishang Night Market. </p>
      <p>The next day, I ate toast for breakfast and took a very long walk, first around Dapo Pond, and then around the rice fields. The day was slightly overcast, and I don't think it was rice season, but the fields gleamed bright green nonetheless, and with quaint irrigation canals and dusty country roads interspersed among the green, the whole scene became a tranquil pastoral wonderland worthy of an airline advertisement featuring Takeshi Kaneshiro. I actually visited his tree first, without having seen the advertisement prior, so I didn't really get the hype. I completed my walk, saddled up, and reached Hualien by early afternoon. Then, in the safety of my room, I watched the EVA airlines advertisement. It brought tears to my eyes. Here was a man, talking about the virtues of travels, the magic of meeting new people, seeing new cultures, seeing "art" and seeing "trust". After riding around close to half of Taiwan, I could definitely relate to that. Anyways, great ad. </p>
