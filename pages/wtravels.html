      <h2>Winter travels</h2>
      <p>I rarely left Hualien last year, except to attend Fulbright conferences in Taipei. Part of it was laziness, part of it contentment to remain tucked away in Taiwan's beautiful backyard.</p>
      <p>That all changed with winter break. After a weekend that included a big New Year's feast at my co-teacher's parent's household, I set out for Taitung by scooter, first by way of Highway 193, which runs alongside Farglory Mountain, and then cutting east towards Highway 11. Even though I've become quite familiar with the coastal highway by now, I still had the chance to stop by some new places, like Jinzunyou Lookout, as well as the beautiful Donghe Bridge, reminiscent of its bigger cousin in Changhong. That night in Taitung, I met up with my Hualien housemate Nick at Star Tribe, a coffeehouse on top of a large mountain overlooking the city. That night was also my first time staying at a hostel. I met some friendly people in the middle of their huandao trip.</p>
      <p>The next day, after enjoying the large breakfast buffet at my hostel, I set off for Kenting. Along the way, I stopped at the peaceful Zhiben Forest Park, and the Duoliang Railway Station to watch trains run along the ocean. I also illegally traversed the Caopu Tunnel, which was fun while it lasted but resulted in a $900 fine. My hotel in Nanwan, Kenting was much nicer than the one in Pingtung, a capsule-style place with tasteful decorations, immaculately-clean bathrooms, and a top-floor lounge offering ocean views and a fridge fully stocked with freshly-made, complimentary winter gourd tea. Day 1 in Kenting, I went to the National Forest and the adjacent Sheding Park, taking in the coral rock formations and seeing a fun rainbow. There were so many families out vacationing for the holidays, which I must admit made feel a little bit lonely as a solo traveller. That afternoon I took a stroll around Eluanbi, and stood in the southernmost point of Taiwan (the island, not the country). Dinner was at the bustling Kenting night market. Day 2 in Kenting, I rode in the other direction, hitting Maobitou, walking atop the historic walls of Hengchun, and then riding to the other side of the park to take a walk along the rocky shores of Jialeshui. I also had some very good ice cream at Gangkou, and patronized the Kenting night market once more. That evening, I met a man named Kenjy at the hostel lounge. He shared some beers with me and we had a friendly conversation. After feeling alone in my travels, I felt a much welcome sense of company. </p>
