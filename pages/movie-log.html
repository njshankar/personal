          <p> A rugged cowboy truck driver assembles a "dream team" to help the middle-aged widow Tampopo in her quest to turn her ramen shop into the best in town. As the synopsis suggests, the film made me very hungry, but there's not much else to dislike about it. It's endlessly charming with a likeable cast of characters (led by an immensely likeable protagonist in Tampopo) and crisp and colorful cinematography. There are a number of quirky, tangential side plots (all food-related) that feel like delighful side dishes in a great big feast. Itami's movie is Tarantino-esque without the gratuitous violence and desperate attempts to seem smart. But above all it's fun; it pulled me in from the very first, fourth-wall-breaking scene. I don't think I've been this dazzled by a film since Tati's <em>Playtime</em>. An indisputable classic of world cinema. </p>

          <p>After their girlfriends leave for a European vacation, two slobbering, sex-obsessed, hard-partying high school boys take a road trip to the beach with a middle-aged woman who is the cousin-in-law of one of the boys. I have trouble coming up with a movie that I would less want to watch with my parents, but threesomes and animalistic sex scenes aside, it's a very sweet and nostalgic story of friendship, and the characters, particularly Luisa, possess true depth. The project benefits from confident direction, as well as crisp, often-handheld cinematography that makes clever use of camera movement; with frequent narration, it unfolds like a short story put to film, a style that I found myself to enjoy very much. Cuaron's three-player affair also serves as a vehicle for highlighting the socioeconomic problems and political turmoil taking place in Mexico at the time, and effectively so. As the narrator, in a hushed and fiery tone, described things like election protests and a migrant worker killed crossing the street and a rural fisherman getting screwed over by the tourist developments, I couldn't help but be reminded of <em>Two or Three Things I Know About Her</em>. Except unlike that incredibly tedious work of Godard's, this one is actually enjoyable to watch. Great acting and wickedly sharp filmmaking.</p>

          <p>A wonderful example of storytelling on film. The very simple plot and gritty, unimpressive production are part of the charm, mirroring the protagonist's own lack of means. The school scenes are some of the most riveting I've seen in a while -- the soccer scene, the employment interview scene, the classroom storytelling scene. They form a startling contrast to Casper's beatific adventures with his bird, and effectively portray the larger societal forces that constrain the boy's future. Even the mean teachers, the uncaring mother, and the wicked brother Jud don't come across as villains, but cogs in an unfortunate machine. </p>

          <p>A tad sentimental for my taste, with a setup unapologetically contrived, but at the end of the day it's a sweet, snow-covered little story that benefits from smooth execution and likeable characters. The plot glides between the present and the high-school past in a graceful way. Nakayama, playing the two leading roles, is understated and endlessly charming; it's a shame she hasn't been in too many more movies. While I don't think <em>Love Letter</em> is quite as good as <em>Lily Chou-Chou</em> (which I consider among my favorite movies), I continue to be impressed by Iwai's beautiful cinematography and moving use of music. </p>

          <p>I don't know if I'm as high on this one as many others seem to be, but I certainly found it to be interesting. The film tells a different, character-driven kind of story than the ones typically portrayed in Hollywood, blending fact and fiction in a unique way. Zhao is a talented, uncompromising filmmaker; McDormand is a heck of an actress, and the rest of the cast, which seems to largely consist of unknown actors/non-actors, shines behind her, lending the movie admirable authenticity. </p>

          <p>It's everything a noir should be -- high-stakes situations, class, an irresistable femme fatale and slick leading man, sharp black-and-white cinematography, a tinge of the exotic. A few spellbinding Rita Hayworth musical numbers make the film truly iconic. Gilda may not be high art a-la Tarkovsky or Bergman, but it pushes all the right buttons and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's the cinematic equivalent of a highly-potent drug.  </p>

          <p>A ridiculously-committed performance by Anthony Hopkins props up an otherwise dreary, mostly incomprehensible affair that reeks of typical prestige drama. Even if it captures the feeling of suffering from dementia, that doesn't make for a strong film. That last scene sure is powerful, though. </p>
