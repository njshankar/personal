          <p> A rugged cowboy truck driver assembles a "dream team" to help the middle-aged widow Tampopo in her quest to turn her ramen shop into the best in town. As the synopsis suggests, the film made me very hungry, but there's not much else to dislike about it. It's endlessly charming with a likeable cast of characters (led by an immensely likeable protagonist in Tampopo) and crisp and colorful cinematography. There are a number of quirky, tangential side plots (all food-related) that feel like delighful side dishes in a great big feast. Itami's movie is Tarantino-esque without the gratuitous violence and desperate attempts to seem smart. But above all it's fun; it pulled me in from the very first, fourth-wall-breaking scene. I don't think I've been this dazzled by a film since Tati's <em>Playtime</em>. An indisputable classic of world cinema. </p>

          <p>After their girlfriends leave for a European vacation, two slobbering, sex-obsessed, hard-partying adolescent boys take a road trip to the beach with a middle-aged woman who is the cousin-in-law of one of the boys. I have trouble coming up with a movie that I would less want to watch with my parents, but threesomes and animalistic sex scenes aside, it's a very sweet and nostalgic story of friendship, and the characters, particularly Luisa, possess true depth. The project benefits from confident direction, as well as crisp, often-handheld cinematography that makes clever use of camera movement; with frequent narration, it unfolds like a short story put to film, a style that I found myself to enjoy very much. Cuaron's three-player affair also serves as a vehicle for highlighting the socioeconomic problems and political turmoil taking place in Mexico at the time, and effectively so. As the narrator, in a hushed and fiery tone, described things like election protests and a migrant worker killed crossing the street and a rural fisherman getting screwed over by the tourist developments, I couldn't help but be reminded of <em>Two or Three Things I Know About Her</em>. Except unlike that incredibly tedious work of Godard's, this one is actually enjoyable to watch. Great acting and wickedly sharp filmmaking.</p>

          <p>A wonderful example of storytelling on film. The very simple plot and gritty, unimpressive production are part of the charm, mirroring the protagonist's own lack of means. The school scenes are some of the most riveting I've seen in a while -- the soccer scene, the employment interview scene, the classroom storytelling scene. They form a startling contrast to Casper's beatific adventures with his bird, and effectively portray the larger societal forces that constrain the boy's future. Even the mean teachers, the uncaring mother, and the wicked brother Jud don't come across as villains, but cogs in an unfortunate machine. </p>

          <p>A tad sentimental for my taste, with a setup unapologetically contrived, but at the end of the day it's a sweet, snow-covered little story that benefits from smooth execution and likeable characters. The plot glides between the present and the high-school past in a graceful way. Nakayama, playing the two leading roles, is understated and endlessly charming; it's a shame she hasn't been in too many more movies. While I don't think <em>Love Letter</em> is quite as good as <em>Lily Chou-Chou</em> (which I consider among my favorite movies), I continue to be impressed by Iwai's beautiful cinematography and moving use of music. </p>

          <p>I don't know if I'm as high on this one as many others seem to be, but I certainly found it to be interesting. The film tells a different, character-driven kind of story than the ones typically portrayed in Hollywood, blending fact and fiction in a unique way. Zhao is a talented, uncompromising filmmaker; McDormand is a heck of an actress, and the rest of the cast, which seems to largely consist of unknown actors/non-actors, shines behind her, lending the movie admirable authenticity. </p>

          <p>It's everything a noir should be -- high-stakes situations, class, an irresistable femme fatale and slick leading man, sharp black-and-white cinematography, a tinge of the exotic. A few spellbinding Rita Hayworth musical numbers make the film truly iconic. Gilda may not be high art a-la Tarkovsky or Bergman, but it pushes all the right buttons and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's the cinematic equivalent of a highly-potent drug.  </p>

          <p>A ridiculously committed performance by Anthony Hopkins props up an otherwise dreary, mostly incomprehensible affair that reeks of typical prestige drama.

          <p>The first 30 minutes possess a beauty that transcends explanation. It may very well be the most powerful half hour I have seen in a movie. The rest of the movie unfolds at a glacial pace, but is redeemed by stunning cinematography (truly, I think, some of the best ever committed to film) and a stunning conclusion that possesses the same kind of transcendental power as the first 30 minutes. Kore-eda's debut feature film may border on being boring at times, but I admire a film with the boldness to stare the uknowable straight in the face, and the magical moments make it worth the watch. </p>

          <p>The first thing I realize after viewing this is how faithful Herzog's remake was. The next thing I realize is how this film is every bit deserving of its vaunted status in cinema. Even 100 years later, it still packs a punch. Featuring plague rats, carnivorous plants, bloodsuckers, expressionist setpieces, and hysteria, histronics, and paranoia of all varietes, Nosferatu breathes chaos. There's nothing remotely subtle about anything it does, but if the purpose of a film is to put on a memorable spectacle, Murnau's film wildly succeeds. </p>

          <p>Yes, the cinematography and soundtrack may be somewhat lazy, overly eager to lean into stereotypical portrayals of the countries the film spans -- mariachis and quinceaneras in Mexico, Arabic music playing over the uncivilized hills of Morocco, glitzy nightclubs in Tokyo. Yes, film, despite its evident ambition to weave together multiple storylines from multiple parts of the world, largely centers the American characters. And yes, the links between said multiple storylines from multiple parts of the world sometimes seem hasty and tangential. But pretensions aside, with its frenzied cinematography and rotating sceneries like channels on a TV, and wonderful performances from actors and actresses of many nations (particularly the Japanese girl Rinko Kikuchi, excluding Cate Blanchett), the film makes for a riveting viewing experience, and oddly enough, has continually wormed its way into my mind in the months since. </p>

          <p>Thematically, when considered with the other Ozu movies I've seen, it seems to be par for the course. But I can't that imagine many filmmakers can do the domestic drama genre better than Ozu, and this is one of his very best. One plot concerns an older couple whose marriage, arranged and loveless for so many years, finally appears to be crumbling, while another main plot concerns the twenty-something niece of the couple, who defies her mother and refuses to enter into an arranged marriage. The events themselves rather predictable, but as usual, it's the irresistably charming flourishes -- wholesome (and not-so-wholesome) intergenerational relationships, stately shots of Tokyo boulevards, the interiors of bustling pachinko parlors, bicycle races and baseball games, and, of course, the taste of green tea over rice -- as well as the earnest screenplay that carry the day. One quote I remember well is that of the uncle, who says that he prefers that things be "simple, down-to-earth, without celebration and affectation." This also seems like a fine encapsulation of Ozu's decidedly unflashy approach to filmmaking, and I can't help but be a sucker for it.</p>

          <p>Stone cold, soul-sucking thriller, masterful in its effectiveness. Reminds me of nothing less than an Edgar Allan Poe story in how it builds up so much dread and tension, particularly through the setting of an isolated country estate. With quietly haunting colors/imagery, captivating performances (the stepmother is alternately pitiful and terrifying, a brilliant enigma of a character), and assured direction, this film is nothing less than flawless for its first 90 minutes. Unfortunately, the last 20 minutes feel overly-cryptic and the revelations that unfold here don't feel entirely convincing or natural given the preceding events (although perhaps if I rewatch it things will make more sense), relying too much on supernatural phenomena and psychological gimmicks. That being said, the final flashback is powerful and emotionally devastating, and I definitely want to check out more of Kim Jee-woon's work!</p>

          <p>I can't say that I was too excited to watch this film, sensing similarities to <em>Equinox Flower</em> and <em>Late Spring</em> in its middle-class-aging-father-trying-to-marry-his-daughter type of plot. I know now that it's so much more -- I'm tempted to view <em>An Autumn Afternoon</em> as Ozu's finest effort. The man is incapable of making a bad film, and all his trademarks are here in full force -- the easygoing conversations between old friends, cozy interior shots of houses, offices, bars, unexpected moments of good-natured humor (faked wakes, marital rows over golf clubs), elegent orchestrals setting the stage for each new scene. What sets this particular effort apart, though, is how deftly it mixes different emotional colors; the subject matter of <em>An Autumn Afternoon</em> (a father realizing that he might be holding back his daughter's life by keeping her around to do chores) on one hand quite depressing, but the story unfolds with such grace and tenderness. In the end, we see the father's daughter forced into marriage, to someone who is essentially a stranger, leaving the father and her brother to live on their own -- this shouldn't feel like a happy conclusion, but I couldn't help but smiling as the credits began to roll. In that final kitchen shot of father and son, it seems like Ozu is trying to tell us that life goes on, and that no matter all will turn out OK. Watching this film makes me realize that great artists, filmmakers or otherwise, don't necessarily need to be highly varied in their styles, plots, or subject matters -- in a sense, it feels much more rewarding to go through the filmography of someone like Ozu, where the variations between films are often slight, subtle, and powerful to appreciate. </p>

          <p>There are certainly things to like about this film, not least the assured editing and cinematography that are trademarks of the immensely talented Park. The first half feels mostly like tablesetting, watching the gears of the titular character's revenge plot snap into motion, but it's an absolute delight to watch her calling in favors from old prison friends, wheeling and dealing her way to a job, an apartment, and the means to get back at the teacher who did her wrong. And of course, lady vengeance herself -- jaw-droppingly beautiful, multitalented, resourceful, driven to achieve her goal -- is an absolute gem of a character. The relationship between mother and daughter (who has been adopted by a family in Australia) is very sweet to watch, too. It's a shame, then, that the second half, in which a prolonged, communal revenge is taken on the child-killing teacher (he's not very convincing as a villain, nor well-developed as a characte), descends into contrived tedium. Perhaps Park is a bit too smart for his own good. </p>

          <p>Like Park's later film <em>The Handmaiden</em>, it's a cold slow-burner for much of its run before transitioning to a brutally violent last act. Park is a sly filmmaker with a wicked artistic sensibility, and while at times he perhaps puts style over substance, there's enough substance here to make this a success, whether it's the delightfully eccentric characterizations -- a mute protagonist who has a devotion to his sister, the protagonist's cocksure anarchist girlfriend, an electrical engineer turned CEO bent on revenge -- the ever-present theme of family, or the finely-tuned plot that features not just one, but multiple revenge storylines. </p>

          <p>Reminds me of Ozu's own <em>Late Spring</em>, another film (in color, this time) centered around marriage and the father-daughter relationship. The focus here is on the father Hirayama, a successful real estate businessman who aims to marry her daughter to a wealthy, well-respected young man. However, these hopes are jeopardized when it is revealed that his daughter intends to marry a co-worker at her chemical company. All in all, it's a well-crafted story of the clashes between the older generation and the free-spirited younger generation of women, who less desire respectability, stability, and tradition than happiness and true love. Probably goes on about 10 or 15 minutes too long, but until then, Ozu can do no wrong. I adore the free-flowing coziness of his films; nothing more than life unfolding onscreen. </p>

          <p>Endlessly charming effort from Ozu, filmed in rich, sharp color. In lieu of an overarching plot, there's 3 or 4 subplots, each with their own quirky comedies -- the dues for the town women's society have gone missing, two brothers vow not to speak to adults, an 20-something English teacher awkwardly pursues his crush, a hapless salesman goes from door to door, selling pencils. The story (or shall I say, stories) takes place against the backdrop of a modernizing, postwar Japanese society, and features a variety of interesting characters. Yoshiko Kuga, in particular, steals the show with her vibrant and bubbly performance as Setsuko. An elegant (which feels strange to say, given that the film film features recurring fart jokes), somewhat whimsical comedy which gives me vibes of Fellini's <em>Amarcord</em>. </p>

          <p>Wonderfully-acted tale of a Korean immigrant family living in rural Arkansas, in line with other Asian-American dramas set on the heartland, such as Andrew Ahn's <em>Driveways</em> or Kogonada's <em>Columbus</em>. Yet Minari shines brighter than those two, with its nuanced, richly drawn characters (the fun-loving, mischevious grandma, in particular), authentic dialogue and relationships, and tender storytelling. The film does an admirable job at not succubming to a "pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps" type of immigrant story, and not putting a focus on racism, discrimination, or the family's cultural experiences. Rather, we get to see the family at its core -- a flawed group of people who have shared many experiences, good and bad, together, with hopes for a better, more stable life that are far from guaranteed. Are the father's dreams of starting a farm the product of a hardworking man who is determined to secure a better life for his family, or man who is more obsessed with quixotic prospects of self achievement than the feelings of those around him? In the midst of the father's struggle, the son, long afflicted with a delicate heart condition, forms a close bond with his grandmother. I can't relate to every aspect of this family's life, but as an Asian midwesterner myself, I'm immensely grateful to see genuine stories like this told onscreen. </p>

          <p>Bi Gan's debut is a lot like <em>Long Day's Journey Into Night</em>, in ways both good and bad. The arresting visuals are here (albeit less impressive than LDJIN, perhaps due to the much smaller budget), as are the impressive long takes -- most prominently, by an extended <em>Russian Ark</em>-style tracking shot that forms the centerpiece of the film. The camera breathtakingly tracks the protagonist as he travels through the hilly countryside on motorcycle, then car, then motorcycle again, sojourning at a mystic concrete riverside town, where the shot now assumes the POV of a local woman, who drifts across the river on boat, then crosses back on bridge to rejoin the protagonist at a streetside pop concert. It's much like that last shot of <em>Long Day's Journey Into Night</em>. As for plot, there's not much to speak of. For some reason I found myself reminded of Altman's <em>The Long Goodbye</em>. The opening 20 minutes breezily introduce the two main brothers, one a neglectful dad, the other an endlessly pensive poet-doctor who has recently gotten out of prison. From there, there's little motivation for any of the events that take place -- as in <em>Long Day's Journey Into Night</em>, things just happen, for better or for worse. The dialogue veers between dreamily profound and cringeworthily pretentious. Bi Gan is at his best when he's not trying to be overtly spiritual or philosophical, but simply telling a story, and pulling his viewers along for the ride; as his first two films show, few other filmmakers can provide such an unpredictable, mind-bending, visually gorgeous ride. </p>

          <p>Everyone talks about <em>The Elephant Man</em> as the "conventional" Lynch movie. While admittedly, its relatively lucid narrative and dramatic performances bear greater resemblance to the prestige biopics which win the hearts of the Academy year after year than the Lynchian madness of <em>Blue Velvet</em> or <em>Inland Empire</em>, this sophomore effort still incorporates several of the director's surealistic flourishes. In fact, the striking black-and-white imagery of Industrial Revolution-era England and the grainy, ambient sound design featured in this film conjure up memories of <em>Eraserhead</em> for me. Perhaps <em>The Elephant Man</em> can be considered a cousin to <em>Los Olvidados</em>, an interesting peek into how an uncompromising surrealist filmmaker tackles a realist story. And Lynch absolutely slays it, bringing forth a classy, crisp, and brutally sympathetic portrait of John Merrick that features wonderful performances from Hopkins (surprise, surprise), Hurts, and the entire cast. I have no doubt that Lynch could have won stacks of Oscars had he stuck to directing movies of this type, which is just another reason why I admire him so much for forsaking easy accolades to pursue his full artistic vision. I do have a few questions, however. How are we to view Merrick's redemptive arc? Are we supposed to admire Dr. Treves and his elite friends for taking Merrick in? If not for their means and status, would they have treated Merrick any differently than the way of the small-time London street crooks? At times, the film seems to be trying to portray some kind of broader message through the story of Merrick, but what exactly this is isn't exactly clear. However, despite the mixed messages, <em>The Elephant Man</em> remains a bona-fide Lynch classic.</p>

          <p>Lubitsch may be my favorite of the classic Hollywood directors, as he never fails to deliver a sharp, light, Euro-infused farce of the utmost elegance. This one is no different. The plot is quite simple: a conman becomes the secretary to a wealthy perfume heiress, aiming to swindle her out of 850,000 francs. However, he soon finds himself caught in a love triangle between the heiress and his longtime lover and partner in crime. A delightful satire of courtship and the callous, corrupt, and awkward business elite which unfolds like a well-oiled machine, it's easy to see why this one has attained such classic status. </p>

          <p>This one's pure fun. Stellar visuals, a freewheeling, suspenseful storyline, riveting and heavily-stylized (Tarantino-esque) violence, combined with a cast of some of the most talented actors and actresses in all of China. While the director's previous film, <em>Black Coal, Thin Ice</em> suffered from slow pacing at several points, <em>The Wild Goose Lake</em>, after an impressive prelude which sets the background, quickly launches into a hard-boiled, rain-slicked game of cat-and-mouse which takes place against the backdrop of the titular seedly locale. I found myself thinking some of Bi Gan's <em>Long Day's Journey Into Night</em> and Park Chan-Wook's <em>Handmaiden</em>, two Asian neo-noirs with similar visual flair, and I'm inclined to prefer this one, as it doesn't take itself too seriously and delivers consistent thrills without descending into overindulgent romance. </p>

          <p>I feel like I've seen this same film countless times before; a crime mystery featuring an unusual incident, many unsavory characters, and a tangled web of conspiracy set in a backwards, rural South Korean town. This one is particularly unremarkable and heavy-handed. The main actress who plays the high-flying lawyer clearly has talent (and the beauty to match), and the ending is quite sweet, but it's a slog to watch, one that takes itself way too seriously.</p>

          <p>An indulgent melodrama tracing the gay romance of a prosperous businessman and a young college student over several years. The style and cinematography are riveting, heavily textured with bold, saturated colors and a sweepingly emotional soundtrack, reminiscent of a Wong Kar-Wai film. I also enjoyed the strong chemistry between the two leads and the passionately romantic story, which despite the turbulence of the events that unfold, portrays the relationship in a very positive manner. My main gripes are the uneven pacing -- because of this, it's often hard to follow exactly what has happened -- and the tragic ending, which seems overwrought, unmotivated, and unnecessary. But overall, a terrific tearjerker from a talented filmmaker.</p>

          <p>There's never much narrative momentum in HHH films, but he usually more than makes up for this with impeccable craft and emotional honesty. This early effort fits the mold, a largely aimless film that follows an aimless group of small-town troublemakers as they go to the city. There are some heartfelt touches, such as the father who became injured in a baseball accident, but even more so than, say, <em>Dust in the Wind</em> or <em>Goodbye South Goodbye</em>, a couple of HHH's more meandering works, this one develops glacially, and feels very raw, as if the director was still discovering his stylistic flair. </p>

          <p>Simple films like this, that take the time to build genuine characters, and aren't afraid to capture the daily rhythms of life and the small, precious memories that lie within, beat formulaic Hollywood biopics and pandering, effect-heavy MCU films anyday. Tian's film, despite its reputed boldness in portraying the dark sides of Chinese communist rule, and its epic, decade-long scale, manages to retain an intimacy, a childlike wonder, just as the best ones, like Hou Hsiao-hsien's <em>A Time to Live, A Time to Die</em>, Yang's <em>A Brighter Summer Day</em>, Zhang's <em>To Live</em>, Tarkovsky's <em>Mirror</em>, even Welles' <em>Citizen Kane</em>, do. The film is structured into three parts -- "Father", "Uncle", and "Stepfather" -- each of which end in similarly tragic ways. While the three father figures each have their differences, they each prove to be temporary presences in Tietou's life, due to the cruel and unpredictable winds of history. With extended family members shuffling in and out as well, his only source of stability is his mother. Despite their at-times turbulent relationship, in the end, each one is all the other has. The film is bookended by images of a faded, lonley blue kite, shimmering in the sky. How achingly beautiful a way to symbolize a lost and broken youth, ravaged by merciless political tides, one redeemed only by love from a few, and quiet, scattered memories that linger like the wind's whisper.</p>

          <p>I must say that I'm quite disappointed in this one. As a visual spectacle, it has its exhilarating moments. At such parts, each frame bursts with wonder, the camera pulling us ever forward in its journey through waterfalls, canyons, volcanoes, office buildings, and the very creation of the universe, examing the majestic spirals of trees and canopied suburban streets alike with rapid, rhythmic cuts, and a sense of childlike fascination. The bright, natural lighting, and the faded, free-flowing dialogue give the whole film an ethereal air, despite the relatively modest nature of the main story. This main story, a tale of family, loss, and adolesence in a small Texas town, while well-acted, is slow and rather unconvincing, and Malick's philosophizing -- he so clearly shoots for profundity here -- does not help. While I admire his work for its vision, risk-taking, and moments of visual poetry, <em>The Tree of Life</em> feels forced, and it has neither the level of stunning visuals nor the level of characterization and frankness (for the former, look to Tarkovsky or Lynch, for the latter, look to Hou Hsiao-hsien, Ozu, Almodovar) to justify its celebrated reputation. </p>

          <p>In the opening shots, we see the aging painter enter his dusty, mostly-empty studio, and carefully measure, sand, and nail together a canvas. Then he sets up his canvas in the backyard, by a small quince tree, its leaves soft green, its bright yellow fruits bursting with roundness. With great precision, he strings a horizontal line of thread in front of the tree, along with a vertical one, from which a small metal pin suspends. With a pencil, the canvas is divided into quadrants. From his assured movements, fluid yet mechanical, it is clear that he has a deep love for both his craft and his subject. He gently nails down two pegs to mark the spot where he stands. He squeezes some paint colors onto his tablet, gently mixes a few together into an olive green shade, and touches brush to canvas. By now, some 20 or 30 wordless minutes have elapsed, every second riveting. A film about a man's months-long effort to paint a tree seems hopelessly dull, so at most, I expected to appreciate this film, but not enjoy it. Yet thanks to Erice's observant cinematography, <em>Quince Tree Sun</em> is not only enjoyable, but fascinating. Other people who move through the painter's studio building -- a trio of construction workers who are trying to learn Spanish by night, a woman engraver -- are shown, as well as the television sets its occupants watch by night, the railyard that lies beyond, and the cityscape as a whole. At the center of it all is the painter, who often has company as he paints -- from his wife and daughters, from an old art school friend, from a Chinese couple. Through close-ups, Erice's camera lovingly captures the tree's vitality, the same vitality that the painter painstakingly tries to recreate on his canvas. But through the autumn months, the tree is ever evolving, its fruit growing, and eventually falling to the ground. Moments of sun are fleeting, stormy days are plenty. Midway, the painter abandons his painting and tries to sketch the tree instead, and effort that is also unsuccessful. Yet despite his failures, if the painter has any bitterness, it doesn't show. He seems to know that the change is inevitable, that it is part of what he does, and seems to have enjoyed the experience of spending intimate time with his tree above all else. While Erice's film admittedly runs about 20 minutes too long, I appreciate it both as a tender character sketch and a commentary on both the ephemerality of beauty and the relationship between painting and film. </p>

          <p>In 1978, a year of "13 moons", during which depression runs particularly high, Elvira, a transgender woman, is left by her boyfriend. Over the course of a few days, she embarks on a lonely odyssey through the city, reflecting and revisiting people from her regret-filled past. With her friend Zora, she visits the slaughterhouse she worked at as a young man, and later the nun who raised him as a boy. She visits the businessman and mobster Anton, whom she once loved before her transition. Fassbinder's messy, electrifying, often surreal film carries a haunting overtone of loss and existential despair. An object of ridicule wherever she goes, Elvira is torn between her previous identity as a married man, and her current identity as a woman, which came about due to a rather rash fit of passion. Deserted at last, knowing that she cannot be fully reunited with her loving ex-wife and daughter, he commits suicide. Evidently, there were people who cared very much for her, yet at the end, they were indifferent, or pre-occupied enough to let her life proceed to its tragic conclusion. The moody, saturated colors, the hurried, rambling dialogue, and the constant interference from either television broadcasts or the film's eclectically operatic soundtrack thrust the viewer into Ervina's confused and deeply-depressed state of mind.  They also make for a positively anxiety-inducing experience, even reminding me at times of the Safdie brothers' <em>Uncut Gems</em>. Yet as frenzied, mystical and cocaine-injected as it feels, <em>13 Moons</em> still has endless capacity for rich aesthetic beauty and delicate compassion for the main character. It seems to me like a movie that only Fassbinder could have made.</p>

          <p>Two siblings, one an eccentric but warm woman fresh off a divorce, the other an alcoholic, womanizing writer of pulpy sex novels, lick their wounds in each other's company in Cassavetes's undeniably strange yet endearing movie. The sister, played by Gena Rowlands, is still fiercely committed to her husband and daughter despite her divorce, and her family's obvious indifference and disdain towards her, believing love to be continuous, like a "stream". The brother, magnificently played by Cassavetes, has evidently refused to commit to anything during his life, disregarding children from his previous marriages, drinking and sleeping around to his heart's content. Like other Cassavetes films I've seen, <em>Love Streams</em> is at times meandering, at times slow, but comforting to watch. His films feel like home movies, with a filmic language, one so wholly his own, that feels to me like the equivalent of slang. Any pretensions of aesthetic grandeur are off the table -- a Cassavetes film hits straight to the source, letting life play out as it is, with all its awkward pauses, stumbles, dead-ends, irregularities, and stupid mistakes. This one often feels comedic, between the inordinate amount of luggage Gena Rowlands' character takes to Paris, the Noah's Ark of animals she brings to her brother's house, her bizarre visions of her family  on the sickbed, or Cassavetes' unbelievable neglect of his estranged son during their trip to Las Vegas. Despite the two siblings' distinctly different outlooks on life and love, and the fact that nothing about their lives seems to really have changed -- the final scene is of a delusional Rowlands leaving to go back to her ex-husband, while Cassavetes looks on in bewilderment -- it's clear that their relationship is one of deep affection and understanding. </p>

          <p>Might just be the best Tsai film I've seen yet, definitely his most tender. This time, the setting is the crowded quarters and hangouts of migrant laborers in Kuala Lumpu, the air soot-filled due to a volcanic eruption in Indonesia. After the opening few scenes, all dialogue virtually disappears, and all that's left is the distant sounds of traffic and city crowds. What's remarkable is that the subtleties of the relationships shine through -- Rawang's compassion and slow-developing love for the Homeless Guy, the cold coexistence between the Maid and her boss, the carnal link between the Homeless Guy and the maid -- despite the fact that nary a word is spoken. Through the way that Rawang looks after the Homeless Guy, later the way the rageful tears stream down his masked face as he threatens to kill the man he loves, or the way the maid meticulously scrubs the Paralyzed Guy's face, we see and feel the deep feelings, yearnings, affections, these characters have for one another. The city may be cold and imposing, but in crossing paths with one another, rather, in clinging to each other desperately, they feel just a bit less alone, and are given the strength to carry on through their thankless lives. </p>

          <p>I don't quite know how to describe this film. There's no conventional narrative to speak of and the pacing is very slow, yet I am mesmerized. With only a few of (mostly interior) settings, and featuring some of the most splendidly haunting low-key lighting ever put on film (some shots put even Lynch's <em>Inland Empire</em> to shame), <em>Colossal Youth</em> has a stagelike quality, or better yet, it feels like the movie takes place inside the belly of some enormous, decaying beast. Without any transition shots, the various rooms and pathways feel disconnected, worlds apart, like far-flung chambers in some forgotten world. An old Cape Verde immigrant man, a retired construction worker named Ventura, has just been thrown out of apartment by his partner. He wanders through the decrepit projects, his walk has an unmistakeable air of dignity, visiting a handful of younger friends to whom he has evidently been a father figure. Vanda is a colorful ex drug addict who finds joy in her caring husband and young child. Lento is a young man with whom he plays cards, and to whom he repeatedly recites a heartfelt and enigmatic letter. Ventura also visits another lonesome woman from time to time, and a slightly older beggar man. To watch him wander about and strike up conversations with this small yet diverse cast of characters is to delve deep into the organs of his memory, to get a feel for the experiences and traumas that have shaped his compassionately-lived life. Deliberative, long static shots basked in chiaroscuro remind me of the work of Tsai Ming-liang, as does the combination of gritty social realism with the dreamlike. Yet in my view, this film ends up feeling much more realer, well, because it's supposedly real, at least the setting and the people are. Costa has distilled the essence of a man's life into this film, a life that might otherwise be overlooked, yet one, as we come to find, that is so rich with beauty. </p>

          <p>Another masterpiece, a tone-poem to urban loneliness. Can't really say too much more Tsai Ming-liang except to re-iterate that he's truly in a class by himself. No one else I know of portrays the unbearable isolation of the human experience in such hard-hitting, poetic terms. Like the three other films I've seen of his, the characters in this film live a marginal existence. All are a little bit eccentric. In this one in particular, though, they desperately search for connection in an indifferent world. A young man sells a watch to a woman who says she is going to Paris. The young man roams the streets of Taipei, obsesseively changing all clocks to Paris time -- he seeks out the films of Truffaut, spends his nights chugging down French wine. The woman wanders through Paris, utterly alone, having no relations and unable to speak the language. The young man's mother, grieving for her recently-deceased husband, turns to spiritual traditions to will him back. The adrift loneliness of the three characters slowly culminates to scenes of sexual release, which seem to function as silent and desperate cries for help. A pale palette of pink, green, and yellow forms a gorgeous, dreamily haunting backdrop to many of Tsai's signature long, static shots. The premise seems rather miserable, but the magic of Tsai is that his minimalist, deadpan style sucks all conventional "drama"  out of the film. His style feels laughably objective, and indeed, with each of the characters' eccentricites, this one is brilliantly comedic -- the young man peeing in a bag and trying to break an unbreakable watch, his mother thinking that her husband has returned because the clock has changed, the woman meeting the actor in <em>The 400 Blows</em> at a Paris cemetery. The return of the father at the end in Paris, another one of Tsai's quiet "jokes", is the triumphant exclamation point. </p>

          <p>Follows the life of a wealthy Cuban intellectual who elects to stay in Cuba, even after the rest of his family goes to the US after the Bay of Pigs invasion. He listlessly wanders the streets and strikes up affairs with women, some real, and some only in his mind. He seems to be so full of contradictions, aspiring to be a European-type and ashamed of his "underdeveloped" island, yet denouncing his fellow American-inspired elites. The format of this film is remarkable -- quick "glancing" shots that portray both things he sees and things he imagines, cutting across various times, mixed in with more traditional, longer takes, as well as documentary footage from the aftermath of Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Such a style reproduces his mundane, restless consciousness while telling a story about his life and a story about Cuba as a whole. I definitely need to see this one again to understand it better.</p>

          <p>I really wanted to like this movie, but what starts out as an extremely promising, slow-building thriller loses restraint and becomes a rather oblique bore. There's some strikingly haunting, dread-inducing imagery here -- that methodical first scene in Taguchi's apartment, the dreamy, balletic march of the deceased woman in the forbidden room scene, the slow communing of a seedy crowd of onlookers after a woman jumps from a tower a bit later -- and the mysteriously-empty buildings and streets of Tokyo accentuate the loneliness of the characters in the internet age. Yet midway, as the central premise (in itself dubiously abstract) is revealed, the film pivots into a dull apocalyptic adventure that drags on about thirty minutes too long. </p>
