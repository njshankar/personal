          <p> A rugged cowboy truck driver helps the middle-aged widow Tampopo in her quest to turn her ramen shop into the best in town. As the synopsis suggests, the film made me very hungry, but there's not much else to dislike about it. It's endlessly charming with a likeable cast of characters (led by an immensely likeable protagonist in Tampopo) and crisp and colorful cinematography. There are a number of quirky, tangential side plots (all food-related) that feel like delighful side dishes in a great big feast. It's Tarantino-esque without the gratuitous violence and smart-assery. But above all it's fun; it pulled me in from the very first, fourth-wall-breaking scene. I don't think I've been this dazzled by a film since Tati's Playtime (Fellini's Amarcord also gave me a somewhat similar feeling). An indisputable classic of world cinema. </p>
