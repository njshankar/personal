          <p> A rugged cowboy truck driver assembles a "dream team" to help the middle-aged widow Tampopo in her quest to turn her ramen shop into the best in town. As the synopsis suggests, the film made me very hungry, but there's not much else to dislike about it. It's endlessly charming with a likeable cast of characters (led by an immensely likeable protagonist in Tampopo) and crisp and colorful cinematography. There are a number of quirky, tangential side plots (all food-related) that feel like delighful side dishes in a great big feast. Itami's movie is Tarantino-esque without the gratuitous violence and desperate attempts to seem smart. But above all it's fun; it pulled me in from the very first, fourth-wall-breaking scene. I don't think I've been this dazzled by a film since Tati's <em>Playtime</em>. An indisputable classic of world cinema. </p>

          <p>After their girlfriends leave for a European vacation, two slobbering, sex-obsessed, hard-partying adolescent boys take a road trip to the beach with a middle-aged woman who is the cousin-in-law of one of the boys. I have trouble coming up with a movie that I would less want to watch with my parents, but threesomes and animalistic sex scenes aside, it's a very sweet and nostalgic story of friendship, and the characters, particularly Luisa, possess true depth. The project benefits from confident direction, as well as crisp, often-handheld cinematography that makes clever use of camera movement; with frequent narration, it unfolds like a short story put to film, a style that I found myself to enjoy very much. Cuaron's three-player affair also serves as a vehicle for highlighting the socioeconomic problems and political turmoil taking place in Mexico at the time, and effectively so. As the narrator, in a hushed and fiery tone, described things like election protests and a migrant worker killed crossing the street and a rural fisherman getting screwed over by the tourist developments, I couldn't help but be reminded of <em>Two or Three Things I Know About Her</em>. Except unlike that incredibly tedious work of Godard's, this one is actually enjoyable to watch. Great acting and wickedly sharp filmmaking.</p>

          <p>A wonderful example of storytelling on film. The very simple plot and gritty, unimpressive production are part of the charm, mirroring the protagonist's own lack of means. The school scenes are some of the most riveting I've seen in a while -- the soccer scene, the employment interview scene, the classroom storytelling scene. They form a startling contrast to Casper's beatific adventures with his bird, and effectively portray the larger societal forces that constrain the boy's future. Even the mean teachers, the uncaring mother, and the wicked brother Jud don't come across as villains, but cogs in an unfortunate machine. </p>

          <p>A tad sentimental for my taste, with a setup unapologetically contrived, but at the end of the day it's a sweet, snow-covered little story that benefits from smooth execution and likeable characters. The plot glides between the present and the high-school past in a graceful way. Nakayama, playing the two leading roles, is understated and endlessly charming; it's a shame she hasn't been in too many more movies. While I don't think <em>Love Letter</em> is quite as good as <em>Lily Chou-Chou</em> (which I consider among my favorite movies), I continue to be impressed by Iwai's beautiful cinematography and moving use of music. </p>

          <p>I don't know if I'm as high on this one as many others seem to be, but I certainly found it to be interesting. The film tells a different, character-driven kind of story than the ones typically portrayed in Hollywood, blending fact and fiction in a unique way. Zhao is a talented, uncompromising filmmaker; McDormand is a heck of an actress, and the rest of the cast, which seems to largely consist of unknown actors/non-actors, shines behind her, lending the movie admirable authenticity. </p>

          <p>It's everything a noir should be -- high-stakes situations, class, an irresistable femme fatale and slick leading man, sharp black-and-white cinematography, a tinge of the exotic. A few spellbinding Rita Hayworth musical numbers make the film truly iconic. Gilda may not be high art a-la Tarkovsky or Bergman, but it pushes all the right buttons and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's the cinematic equivalent of a highly-potent drug.  </p>

          <p>A ridiculously committed performance by Anthony Hopkins props up an otherwise dreary, mostly incomprehensible affair that reeks of typical prestige drama.

          <p>The first 30 minutes possess a beauty that transcends explanation. It may very well be the most powerful half hour I have seen in a movie. The rest of the movie unfolds at a glacial pace, but is redeemed by stunning cinematography (truly, I think, some of the best ever committed to film) and a stunning conclusion that possesses the same kind of transcendental power as the first 30 minutes. Kore-eda's debut feature film may border on being boring at times, but I admire a film with the boldness to stare the uknowable straight in the face, and the magical moments make it worth the watch. </p>

          <p>The first thing I realize after viewing this is how faithful Herzog's remake was. The next thing I realize is how this film is every bit deserving of its vaunted status in cinema. Even 100 years later, it still packs a punch. Featuring plague rats, carnivorous plants, bloodsuckers, expressionist setpieces, and hysteria, histronics, and paranoia of all varietes, Nosferatu breathes chaos. There's nothing remotely subtle about anything it does, but if the purpose of a film is to put on a memorable spectacle, Murnau's film wildly succeeds. </p>

          <p>Yes, the cinematography and soundtrack may be somewhat lazy, overly eager to lean into stereotypical portrayals of the countries the film spans -- mariachis and quinceaneras in Mexico, Arabic music playing over the uncivilized hills of Morocco, glitzy nightclubs in Tokyo. Yes, film, despite its evident ambition to weave together multiple storylines from multiple parts of the world, largely centers the American characters. And yes, the links between said multiple storylines from multiple parts of the world sometimes seem hasty and tangential. But pretensions aside, with its frenzied cinematography and rotating sceneries like channels on a TV, and wonderful performances from actors and actresses of many nations (particularly the Japanese girl Rinko Kikuchi, excluding Cate Blanchett), the film makes for a riveting viewing experience, and oddly enough, has continually wormed its way into my mind in the months since. </p>

          <p>Thematically, when considered with the other Ozu movies I've seen, it seems to be par for the course. But I can't that imagine many filmmakers can do the domestic drama genre better than Ozu, and this is one of his very best. One plot concerns an older couple whose marriage, arranged and loveless for so many years, finally appears to be crumbling, while another main plot concerns the twenty-something niece of the couple, who defies her mother and refuses to enter into an arranged marriage. The events themselves rather predictable, but as usual, it's the irresistably charming flourishes -- wholesome (and not-so-wholesome) intergenerational relationships, stately shots of Tokyo boulevards, the interiors of bustling pachinko parlors, bicycle races and baseball games, and, of course, the taste of green tea over rice -- as well as the earnest screenplay that carry the day. One quote I remember well is that of the uncle, who says that he prefers that things be "simple, down-to-earth, without celebration and affectation." This also seems like a fine encapsulation of Ozu's decidedly unflashy approach to filmmaking, and I can't help but be a sucker for it.</p>

          <p>Stone cold, soul-sucking thriller, masterful in its effectiveness. Reminds me of nothing less than an Edgar Allan Poe story in how it builds up so much dread and tension, particularly through the setting of an isolated country estate. With quietly haunting colors/imagery, captivating performances (the stepmother is alternately pitiful and terrifying, a brilliant enigma of a character), and assured direction, this film is nothing less than flawless for its first 90 minutes. Unfortunately, the last 20 minutes feel overly-cryptic and the revelations that unfold here don't feel entirely convincing or natural given the preceding events (although perhaps if I rewatch it things will make more sense), relying too much on supernatural phenomena and psychological gimmicks. That being said, the final flashback is powerful and emotionally devastating, and I definitely want to check out more of Kim Jee-woon's work!</p>

          <p>I can't say that I was too excited to watch this film, sensing similarities to <em>Equinox Flower</em> and <em>Late Spring</em> in its middle-class-aging-father-trying-to-marry-his-daughter type of plot. I know now that it's so much more -- I'm tempted to view <em>An Autumn Afternoon</em> as Ozu's finest effort. The man is incapable of making a bad film, and all his trademarks are here in full force -- the easygoing conversations between old friends, cozy interior shots of houses, offices, bars, unexpected moments of good-natured humor (faked wakes, marital rows over golf clubs), elegent orchestrals setting the stage for each new scene. What sets this particular effort apart, though, is how deftly it mixes different emotional colors; the subject matter of <em>An Autumn Afternoon</em> (a father realizing that he might be holding back his daughter's life by keeping her around to do chores) on one hand quite depressing, but the story unfolds with such grace and tenderness. In the end, we see the father's daughter forced into marriage, to someone who is essentially a stranger, leaving the father and her brother to live on their own -- this shouldn't feel like a happy conclusion, but I couldn't help but smiling as the credits began to roll. In that final kitchen shot of father and son, it seems like Ozu is trying to tell us that life goes on, and that no matter all will turn out OK. Watching this film makes me realize that great artists, filmmakers or otherwise, don't necessarily need to be highly varied in their styles, plots, or subject matters -- in a sense, it feels much more rewarding to go through the filmography of someone like Ozu, where the variations between films are often slight, subtle, and powerful to appreciate. </p>

          <p>There are certainly things to like about this film, not least the assured editing and cinematography that are trademarks of the immensely talented Park. The first half feels mostly like tablesetting, watching the gears of the titular character's revenge plot snap into motion, but it's an absolute delight to watch her calling in favors from old prison friends, wheeling and dealing her way to a job, an apartment, and the means to get back at the teacher who did her wrong. And of course, lady vengeance herself -- jaw-droppingly beautiful, multitalented, resourceful, driven to achieve her goal -- is an absolute gem of a character. The relationship between mother and daughter (who has been adopted by a family in Australia) is very sweet to watch, too. It's a shame, then, that the second half, in which a prolonged, communal revenge is taken on the child-killing teacher (he's not very convincing as a villain, nor well-developed as a characte), descends into contrived tedium. Perhaps Park is a bit too smart for his own good. </p>

          <p>Like Park's later film <em>The Handmaiden</em>, it's a cold slow-burner for much of its run before transitioning to a brutally violent last act. Park is a sly filmmaker with a wicked artistic sensibility, and while at times he perhaps puts style over substance, there's enough substance here to make this a success, whether it's the delightfully eccentric characterizations -- a mute protagonist who has a devotion to his sister, the protagonist's cocksure anarchist girlfriend, an electrical engineer turned CEO bent on revenge -- the ever-present theme of family, or the finely-tuned plot that features not just one, but multiple revenge storylines. </p>

          <p>Reminds me of Ozu's own <em>Late Spring</em>, another film (in color, this time) centered around marriage and the father-daughter relationship. The focus here is on the father Hirayama, a successful real estate businessman who aims to marry her daughter to a wealthy, well-respected young man. However, these hopes are jeopardized when it is revealed that his daughter intends to marry a co-worker at her chemical company. All in all, it's a well-crafted story of the clashes between the older generation and the free-spirited younger generation of women, who less desire respectability, stability, and tradition than happiness and true love. Probably goes on about 10 or 15 minutes too long, but until then, Ozu can do no wrong. I adore the free-flowing coziness of his films; nothing more than life unfolding onscreen. </p>

          <p>Endlessly charming effort from Ozu, filmed in rich, sharp color. In lieu of an overarching plot, there's 3 or 4 subplots, each with their own quirky comedies -- the dues for the town women's society have gone missing, two brothers vow not to speak to adults, an 20-something English teacher awkwardly pursues his crush, a hapless salesman goes from door to door, selling pencils. The story (or shall I say, stories) takes place against the backdrop of a modernizing, postwar Japanese society, and features a variety of interesting characters. Yoshiko Kuga, in particular, steals the show with her vibrant and bubbly performance as Setsuko. An elegant (which feels strange to say, given that the film film features recurring fart jokes), somewhat whimsical comedy which gives me vibes of Fellini's <em>Amarcord</em>. </p>

          <p>Wonderfully-acted tale of a Korean immigrant family living in rural Arkansas, in line with other Asian-American dramas set on the heartland, such as Andrew Ahn's <em>Driveways</em> or Kogonada's <em>Columbus</em>. Yet Minari shines brighter than those two, with its nuanced, richly drawn characters (the fun-loving, mischevious grandma, in particular), authentic dialogue and relationships, and tender storytelling. The film does an admirable job at not succubming to a "pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps" type of immigrant story, and not putting a focus on racism, discrimination, or the family's cultural experiences. Rather, we get to see the family at its core -- a flawed group of people who have shared many experiences, good and bad, together, with hopes for a better, more stable life that are far from guaranteed. Are the father's dreams of starting a farm the product of a hardworking man who is determined to secure a better life for his family, or man who is more obsessed with quixotic prospects of self achievement than the feelings of those around him? In the midst of the father's struggle, the son, long afflicted with a delicate heart condition, forms a close bond with his grandmother. I can't relate to every aspect of this family's life, but as an Asian midwesterner myself, I'm immensely grateful to see genuine stories like this told onscreen. </p>

          <p>Bi Gan's debut is a lot like <em>Long Day's Journey Into Night</em>, in ways both good and bad. The arresting visuals are here (albeit less impressive than LDJIN, perhaps due to the much smaller budget), as are the impressive long takes -- most prominently, by an extended <em>Russian Ark</em>-style tracking shot that forms the centerpiece of the film. The camera breathtakingly tracks the protagonist as he travels through the hilly countryside on motorcycle, then car, then motorcycle again, sojourning at a mystic concrete riverside town, where the shot now assumes the POV of a local woman, who drifts across the river on boat, then crosses back on bridge to rejoin the protagonist at a streetside pop concert. It's much like that last shot of <em>Long Day's Journey Into Night</em>. As for plot, there's not much to speak of. For some reason I found myself reminded of Altman's <em>The Long Goodbye</em>. The opening 20 minutes breezily introduce the two main brothers, one a neglectful dad, the other an endlessly pensive poet-doctor who has recently gotten out of prison. From there, there's little motivation for any of the events that take place -- as in <em>Long Day's Journey Into Night</em>, things just happen, for better or for worse. The dialogue veers between dreamily profound and cringeworthily pretentious. Bi Gan is at his best when he's not trying to be overtly spiritual or philosophical, but simply telling a story, and pulling his viewers along for the ride; as his first two films show, few other filmmakers can provide such an unpredictable, mind-bending, visually gorgeous ride. </p>

          <p>Everyone talks about <em>The Elephant Man</em> as the "conventional" Lynch movie. While admittedly, its relatively lucid narrative and dramatic performances bear greater resemblance to the prestige biopics which win the hearts of the Academy year after year than the Lynchian madness of <em>Blue Velvet</em> or <em>Inland Empire</em>, this sophomore effort still incorporates several of the director's surealistic flourishes. In fact, the striking black-and-white imagery of Industrial Revolution-era England and the grainy, ambient sound design featured in this film conjure up memories of <em>Eraserhead</em> for me. Perhaps <em>The Elephant Man</em> can be considered a cousin to <em>Los Olvidados</em>, an interesting peek into how an uncompromising surrealist filmmaker tackles a realist story. And Lynch absolutely slays it, bringing forth a classy, crisp, and brutally sympathetic portrait of John Merrick that features wonderful performances from Hopkins (surprise, surprise), Hurts, and the entire cast. I have no doubt that Lynch could have won stacks of Oscars had he stuck to directing movies of this type, which is just another reason why I admire him so much for forsaking easy accolades to pursue his full artistic vision. I do have a few questions, however. How are we to view Merrick's redemptive arc? Are we supposed to admire Dr. Treves and his elite friends for taking Merrick in? If not for their means and status, would they have treated Merrick any differently than the way of the small-time London street crooks? At times, the film seems to be trying to portray some kind of broader message through the story of Merrick, but what exactly this is isn't exactly clear. However, despite the mixed messages, <em>The Elephant Man</em> remains a bona-fide Lynch classic.</p>

          <p>Lubitsch may be my favorite of the classic Hollywood directors, as he never fails to deliver a sharp, light, Euro-infused farce of the utmost elegance. This one is no different. The plot is quite simple: a conman becomes the secretary to a wealthy perfume heiress, aiming to swindle her out of 850,000 francs. However, he soon finds himself caught in a love triangle between the heiress and his longtime lover and partner in crime. A delightful satire of courtship and the callous, corrupt, and awkward business elite which unfolds like a well-oiled machine, it's easy to see why this one has attained such classic status. </p>

          <p>This one's pure fun. Stellar visuals, a freewheeling, suspenseful storyline, riveting and heavily-stylized (Tarantino-esque) violence, combined with a cast of some of the most talented actors and actresses in all of China. While the director's previous film, <em>Black Coal, Thin Ice</em> suffered from slow pacing at several points, <em>The Wild Goose Lake</em>, after an impressive prelude which sets the background, quickly launches into a hard-boiled, rain-slicked game of cat-and-mouse which takes place against the backdrop of the titular seedly locale. I found myself thinking some of Bi Gan's <em>Long Day's Journey Into Night</em> and Park Chan-Wook's <em>Handmaiden</em>, two Asian neo-noirs with similar visual flair, and I'm inclined to prefer this one, as it doesn't take itself too seriously and delivers consistent thrills without descending into overindulgent romance. </p>

          <p>I feel like I've seen this same film countless times before; a crime mystery featuring an unusual incident, many unsavory characters, and a tangled web of conspiracy set in a backwards, rural South Korean town. This one is particularly unremarkable and heavy-handed. The main actress who plays the high-flying lawyer clearly has talent (and the beauty to match), and the ending is quite sweet, but it's a slog to watch, one that takes itself way too seriously.</p>

          <p>An indulgent melodrama tracing the gay romance of a prosperous businessman and a young college student over several years. The style and cinematography are riveting, heavily textured with bold, saturated colors and a sweepingly emotional soundtrack, reminiscent of a Wong Kar-Wai film. I also enjoyed the strong chemistry between the two leads and the passionately romantic story, which despite the turbulence of the events that unfold, portrays the relationship in a very positive manner. My main gripes are the uneven pacing -- because of this, it's often hard to follow exactly what has happened -- and the tragic ending, which seems overwrought, unmotivated, and unnecessary. But overall, a terrific tearjerker from a talented filmmaker.</p>

          <p>There's never much narrative momentum in HHH films, but he usually more than makes up for this with impeccable craft and emotional honesty. This early effort fits the mold, a largely aimless film that follows an aimless group of small-town troublemakers as they go to the city. There are some heartfelt touches, such as the father who became injured in a baseball accident, but even more so than, say, <em>Dust in the Wind</em> or <em>Goodbye South Goodbye</em>, a couple of HHH's more meandering works, this one develops glacially, and feels very raw, as if the director was still discovering his stylistic flair. </p>

          <p>Simple films like this, that take the time to build genuine characters, and aren't afraid to capture the daily rhythms of life and the small, precious memories that lie within, beat formulaic Hollywood biopics and pandering, effect-heavy MCU films anyday. Tian's film, despite its reputed boldness in portraying the dark sides of Chinese communist rule, and its epic, decade-long scale, manages to retain an intimacy, a childlike wonder, just as the best ones, like Hou Hsiao-hsien's <em>A Time to Live, A Time to Die</em>, Yang's <em>A Brighter Summer Day</em>, Zhang's <em>To Live</em>, Tarkovsky's <em>Mirror</em>, even Welles' <em>Citizen Kane</em>, do. The film is structured into three parts -- "Father", "Uncle", and "Stepfather" -- each of which end in similarly tragic ways. While the three father figures each have their differences, they each prove to be temporary presences in Tietou's life, due to the cruel and unpredictable winds of history. With extended family members shuffling in and out as well, his only source of stability is his mother. Despite their at-times turbulent relationship, in the end, each one is all the other has. The film is bookended by images of a faded, lonley blue kite, shimmering in the sky. How achingly beautiful a way to symbolize a lost and broken youth, ravaged by merciless political tides, one redeemed only by love from a few, and quiet, scattered memories that linger like the wind's whisper.</p>

          <p>I must say that I'm quite disappointed in this one. As a visual spectacle, it has its exhilarating moments. At such parts, each frame bursts with wonder, the camera pulling us ever forward in its journey through waterfalls, canyons, volcanoes, office buildings, and the very creation of the universe, examing the majestic spirals of trees and canopied suburban streets alike with rapid, rhythmic cuts, and a sense of childlike fascination. The bright, natural lighting, and the faded, free-flowing dialogue give the whole film an ethereal air, despite the relatively modest nature of the main story. This main story, a tale of family, loss, and adolesence in a small Texas town, while well-acted, is slow and rather unconvincing, and Malick's philosophizing -- he so clearly shoots for profundity here -- does not help. While I admire his work for its vision, risk-taking, and moments of visual poetry, <em>The Tree of Life</em> feels forced, and it has neither the level of stunning visuals nor the level of characterization and frankness (for the former, look to Tarkovsky or Lynch, for the latter, look to Hou Hsiao-hsien, Ozu, Almodovar) to justify its celebrated reputation. </p>

          <p>In the opening shots, we see the aging painter enter his dusty, mostly-empty studio, and carefully measure, sand, and nail together a canvas. Then he sets up his canvas in the backyard, by a small quince tree, its leaves soft green, its bright yellow fruits bursting with roundness. With great precision, he strings a horizontal line of thread in front of the tree, along with a vertical one, from which a small metal pin suspends. With a pencil, the canvas is divided into quadrants. From his assured movements, fluid yet mechanical, it is clear that he has a deep love for both his craft and his subject. He gently nails down two pegs to mark the spot where he stands. He squeezes some paint colors onto his tablet, gently mixes a few together into an olive green shade, and touches brush to canvas. By now, some 20 or 30 wordless minutes have elapsed, every second riveting. A film about a man's months-long effort to paint a tree seems hopelessly dull, so at most, I expected to appreciate this film, but not enjoy it. Yet thanks to Erice's observant cinematography, <em>Quince Tree Sun</em> is not only enjoyable, but fascinating. Other people who move through the painter's studio building -- a trio of construction workers who are trying to learn Spanish by night, a woman engraver -- are shown, as well as the television sets its occupants watch by night, the railyard that lies beyond, and the cityscape as a whole. At the center of it all is the painter, who often has company as he paints -- from his wife and daughters, from an old art school friend, from a Chinese couple. Through close-ups, Erice's camera lovingly captures the tree's vitality, the same vitality that the painter painstakingly tries to recreate on his canvas. But through the autumn months, the tree is ever evolving, its fruit growing, and eventually falling to the ground. Moments of sun are fleeting, stormy days are plenty. Midway, the painter abandons his painting and tries to sketch the tree instead, and effort that is also unsuccessful. Yet despite his failures, if the painter has any bitterness, it doesn't show. He seems to know that the change is inevitable, that it is part of what he does, and seems to have enjoyed the experience of spending intimate time with his tree above all else. While Erice's film admittedly runs about 20 minutes too long, I appreciate it both as a tender character sketch and a commentary on both the ephemerality of beauty and the relationship between painting and film. </p>

          <p>In 1978, a year of "13 moons", during which depression runs particularly high, Elvira, a transgender woman, is left by her boyfriend. Over the course of a few days, she embarks on a lonely odyssey through the city, reflecting and revisiting people from her regret-filled past. With her friend Zora, she visits the slaughterhouse she worked at as a young man, and later the nun who raised him as a boy. She visits the businessman and mobster Anton, whom she once loved before her transition. Fassbinder's messy, electrifying, often surreal film carries a haunting overtone of loss and existential despair. An object of ridicule wherever she goes, Elvira is torn between her previous identity as a married man, and her current identity as a woman, which came about due to a rather rash fit of passion. Deserted at last, knowing that she cannot be fully reunited with her loving ex-wife and daughter, he commits suicide. Evidently, there were people who cared very much for her, yet at the end, they were indifferent, or pre-occupied enough to let her life proceed to its tragic conclusion. The moody, saturated colors, the hurried, rambling dialogue, and the constant interference from either television broadcasts or the film's eclectically operatic soundtrack thrust the viewer into Ervina's confused and deeply-depressed state of mind.  They also make for a positively anxiety-inducing experience, even reminding me at times of the Safdie brothers' <em>Uncut Gems</em>. Yet as frenzied, mystical and cocaine-injected as it feels, <em>13 Moons</em> still has endless capacity for rich aesthetic beauty and delicate compassion for the main character. It seems to me like a movie that only Fassbinder could have made.</p>

          <p>Two siblings, one an eccentric but warm woman fresh off a divorce, the other an alcoholic, womanizing writer of pulpy sex novels, lick their wounds in each other's company in Cassavetes's undeniably strange yet endearing movie. The sister, played by Gena Rowlands, is still fiercely committed to her husband and daughter despite her divorce, and her family's obvious indifference and disdain towards her, believing love to be continuous, like a "stream". The brother, magnificently played by Cassavetes, has evidently refused to commit to anything during his life, disregarding children from his previous marriages, drinking and sleeping around to his heart's content. Like other Cassavetes films I've seen, <em>Love Streams</em> is at times meandering, at times slow, but comforting to watch. His films feel like home movies, with a filmic language, one so wholly his own, that feels to me like the equivalent of slang. Any pretensions of aesthetic grandeur are off the table -- a Cassavetes film hits straight to the source, letting life play out as it is, with all its awkward pauses, stumbles, dead-ends, irregularities, and stupid mistakes. This one often feels comedic, between the inordinate amount of luggage Gena Rowlands' character takes to Paris, the Noah's Ark of animals she brings to her brother's house, her bizarre visions of her family  on the sickbed, or Cassavetes' unbelievable neglect of his estranged son during their trip to Las Vegas. Despite the two siblings' distinctly different outlooks on life and love, and the fact that nothing about their lives seems to really have changed -- the final scene is of a delusional Rowlands leaving to go back to her ex-husband, while Cassavetes looks on in bewilderment -- it's clear that their relationship is one of deep affection and understanding. </p>

          <p>Might just be the best Tsai film I've seen yet, definitely his most tender. This time, the setting is the crowded quarters and hangouts of migrant laborers in Kuala Lumpu, the air soot-filled due to a volcanic eruption in Indonesia. After the opening few scenes, all dialogue virtually disappears, and all that's left is the distant sounds of traffic and city crowds. What's remarkable is that the subtleties of the relationships shine through -- Rawang's compassion and slow-developing love for the Homeless Guy, the cold coexistence between the Maid and her boss, the carnal link between the Homeless Guy and the maid -- despite the fact that nary a word is spoken. Through the way that Rawang looks after the Homeless Guy, later the way the rageful tears stream down his masked face as he threatens to kill the man he loves, or the way the maid meticulously scrubs the Paralyzed Guy's face, we see and feel the deep feelings, yearnings, affections, these characters have for one another. The city may be cold and imposing, but in crossing paths with one another, rather, in clinging to each other desperately, they feel just a bit less alone, and are given the strength to carry on through their thankless lives. </p>

          <p>I don't quite know how to describe this film. There's no conventional narrative to speak of and the pacing is very slow, yet I am mesmerized. With only a few of (mostly interior) settings, and featuring some of the most splendidly haunting low-key lighting ever put on film (some shots put even Lynch's <em>Inland Empire</em> to shame), <em>Colossal Youth</em> has a stagelike quality, or better yet, it feels like the movie takes place inside the belly of some enormous, decaying beast. Without any transition shots, the various rooms and pathways feel disconnected, worlds apart, like far-flung chambers in some forgotten world. An old Cape Verde immigrant man, a retired construction worker named Ventura, has just been thrown out of apartment by his partner. He wanders through the decrepit projects, his walk has an unmistakeable air of dignity, visiting a handful of younger friends to whom he has evidently been a father figure. Vanda is a colorful ex drug addict who finds joy in her caring husband and young child. Lento is a young man with whom he plays cards, and to whom he repeatedly recites a heartfelt and enigmatic letter. Ventura also visits another lonesome woman from time to time, and a slightly older beggar man. To watch him wander about and strike up conversations with this small yet diverse cast of characters is to delve deep into the organs of his memory, to get a feel for the experiences and traumas that have shaped his compassionately-lived life. Deliberative, long static shots basked in chiaroscuro remind me of the work of Tsai Ming-liang, as does the combination of gritty social realism with the dreamlike. Yet in my view, this film ends up feeling much more realer, well, because it's supposedly real, at least the setting and the people are. Costa has distilled the essence of a man's life into this film, a life that might otherwise be overlooked, yet one, as we come to find, that is so rich with beauty. </p>

          <p>Another masterpiece, a tone-poem to urban loneliness. Can't really say too much more Tsai Ming-liang except to re-iterate that he's truly in a class by himself. No one else I know of portrays the unbearable isolation of the human experience in such hard-hitting, poetic terms. Like the three other films I've seen of his, the characters in this film live a marginal existence. All are a little bit eccentric. In this one in particular, though, they desperately search for connection in an indifferent world. A young man sells a watch to a woman who says she is going to Paris. The young man roams the streets of Taipei, obsesseively changing all clocks to Paris time -- he seeks out the films of Truffaut, spends his nights chugging down French wine. The woman wanders through Paris, utterly alone, having no relations and unable to speak the language. The young man's mother, grieving for her recently-deceased husband, turns to spiritual traditions to will him back. The adrift loneliness of the three characters slowly culminates to scenes of sexual release, which seem to function as silent and desperate cries for help. A pale palette of pink, green, and yellow forms a gorgeous, dreamily haunting backdrop to many of Tsai's signature long, static shots. The premise seems rather miserable, but the magic of Tsai is that his minimalist, deadpan style sucks all conventional "drama"  out of the film. His style feels laughably objective, and indeed, with each of the characters' eccentricites, this one is brilliantly comedic -- the young man peeing in a bag and trying to break an unbreakable watch, his mother thinking that her husband has returned because the clock has changed, the woman meeting the actor in <em>The 400 Blows</em> at a Paris cemetery. The return of the father at the end in Paris, another one of Tsai's quiet "jokes", is the triumphant exclamation point. </p>

          <p>Follows the life of a wealthy Cuban intellectual who elects to stay in Cuba, even after the rest of his family goes to the US after the Bay of Pigs invasion. He listlessly wanders the streets and strikes up affairs with women, some real, and some only in his mind. He seems to be so full of contradictions, aspiring to be a European-type and ashamed of his "underdeveloped" island, yet denouncing his fellow American-inspired elites. The format of this film is remarkable -- quick "glancing" shots that portray both things he sees and things he imagines, cutting across various times, mixed in with more traditional, longer takes, as well as documentary footage from the aftermath of Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Such a style reproduces his mundane, restless consciousness while telling a story about his life and a story about Cuba as a whole. I definitely need to see this one again to understand it better.</p>

          <p>I really wanted to like this movie, but what starts out as an extremely promising, slow-building thriller loses restraint and becomes a rather oblique bore. There's some strikingly haunting, dread-inducing imagery here -- that methodical first scene in Taguchi's apartment, the dreamy, balletic march of the deceased woman in the forbidden room scene, the slow communing of a seedy crowd of onlookers after a woman jumps from a tower a bit later -- and the mysteriously-empty buildings and streets of Tokyo accentuate the loneliness of the characters in the internet age. Yet midway, as the central premise (in itself dubiously abstract) is revealed, the film pivots into a dull apocalyptic adventure that drags on about thirty minutes too long. </p>

          <p>Dialogue-driven and rather hard to follow, this is not HHH's best effort, but it's a decent one nonetheless, largely due to its entertaning characters and gleefully gritty atmospherics. The still camera of <em>The Puppetmaster</em> is forsaken for moving shots that gracefully drift about the rooms and seedy locales that the two lowlifes at the center of the story inhabit. In this regard, this film reminded me of HHH's later work <em>Flowers of Shanghai</em>. In addition, the recurring train imagery that appears in the films of HHH is present here (<em>Dust in the Wind</em>, <em>Milennium Mambo</em>, <em>Cafe Lumiere</em>), perhaps in its most purely pretty form, as we see old locomotives staggering through sleepy towns, winding their paths through gorgeous mountain scenery. We also see long shots of cars and motorcycles making their journeys, a reflection of the wandering lifestyles of the main characters. The idyllic, peaceful landscape of rural Taiwan forms a fitting backdrop to the rather haphazard and bumbling adventures of Gao and Flatty, who are joined by Flatty's fun-loving and oblivious girlfriend Pretzel. Despite the fact that they can't seem to do anything right -- whether it's a scheme selling pigs to the government, investing in mainland China, demanding inheritance money from Flatty's cousin, or even driving a car -- it's hard to take them or their troubles too seriously. After all, they are simple people who seem to enjoy life, mere minnows compared to corrupt policemen and politicians like Flatty's cousin and the hilariously-named Uncle Senator. It's not the payoff (or lack thereof) that counts, it's the stupid adventures along the way. Such seems to be the main takeaway from HHH's goodhearted, glacially-paced comedy-of-errors. </p>

          <p>I had a soft spot for this film coming in, knowing that it was made by an Asian-American Illinois filmmaker, but it didn't disappoint. Whereas many documentaries these days seem motivated in ideology, trying to convince us of something or incite us to action, this one delves deeply into the lives of three skateboarders, each at different stages and with different ambitions in life, each deeply flawed, each scarred by the male figures in their lives and trying to break out of this toxic cycle of abuse, as well as the bleak prospects in their city of Rockford, Illinois. Keire is a young man, still traumatized by the violent relationship he had with his late father, who finds a job as a dishwasher, with the hopes of establishing independence from his family. Zack is a little bit older, a new father who struggles with a lifestyle of drinking and domestic abuse. Finally, Liu himself is scarred by the abuse he suffered at the hands of his white stepfather. All three we find ourselves rooting for. Props to Liu -- he succeeds in getting his subjects to talk about their lives and emotions in such raw and honest terms. Over the course of the 1.5 hours, we come to see and understand their worldviews and motivations, their humanity, and the sometimes destructive, sometimes blissful ways by which their find their release. The smooth, extended tracking shots of skateboarding down the empty streets of downtown Rockford are pure poetry, we can feel the freedom that it brings to the otherwise troubled lives of the skateboarders. For the most part, until the rather sentimental last ten minutes, Liu deftly and objectively covers his subjects, handling topics such as toxic masculinity, domestic violence, family, and race. The film succeeds so well because Liu never has to make it directly clear that he is covering these topics -- devastatingly, they are simly so prevalent in the lives of the subjects, in that part of Rockford, that they come up over and over again, on their own. He lets his subjects explain them in their own terms, letting the viewer make the connections for themself. </p>

          <p>Fascinating, tightly-wound movie with a singular focus. Like Kaurismaki's <em>Match Factory Girl</em>, not a single second is wasted. Its murkily enticing mix of fiction and reality recalls works such as Kiarostami's <em>Close-Up</em> (about Makhmalbaf himself) and <em>The Act of Killing</em>. <em>Rashomon</em>-like in the way it uses an innovative narrative framework to unpack a brief but immensely consequential episode. Makhmalbaf stars as himself trying to make a film about a (real) moment in his life when he stabbed a Royalist policeman to procure his gun. Himself and the policeman from the original incident, (older and still heartbroken over a girl from that time, who in fact was Makhmalbaf's cousin and accomplice), direct the younger versions of themselves. That final freeze frame -- of the young policeman extending a flowerpot to the young cousin, with a bewildered young Makhmalbaf to the right side -- is astounding, both in its suddenness and exquisite beauty, but the journey to this closing shot was equally affecting for me. With a bittersweet humor, Makhmalbaf's film lightly forays into the past, allowing us to see its impact on those involved. The policeman's inability to forget the girl from so many years ago, and his pride for his days as a Royalist guard, show through his rigorous coaching of his understudy, and desire to meticulously recreate the scene in question.  This, along with the youthful idealism of young Makhmalbaf and the young cousin, is contrasted with the indifference of the older Makhmalbaf. And the dark, narrow hallways of the old bazaar serve as the perfect backdrop for the story. </p>

          <p>Deliberately-paced slice-of-life movie. Seems almost sluggishly uneventful, but it really grew on me as it passed. Very different, but feels like something of a companion piece to his previous film <em>Milennium Mambo</em>. If <em>Milennium Mambo</em> juxtaposed the dreariness of the characters' lives in spite of their reckless, hard-partying lifestyle, Cafe Lumiere juxtaposes the small joys the characters feel in spite of their meandering, decidedly unmaterialistic pursuits. Yoko, a writer, excitedly pursues facts about the life of a deceased piano composer -- her leisurely search leads her to a conversation with the composer's widow, and to the former site of a cafe where the composer spent his time. It is not exactly clear whether it has resulted in any tangible outcomes. Along the way, she eagerly tries to decode a strange dream she had. She lives in a small apartment, pregnant with a baby whose father is her Taiwanese boyfriend that she refuses to marry. Her loving, comfortably-retired parents never miss an opportunity to chide her for her lack of income, yet Yoko herself seems absolutely unconcerned.  Yoko's friend Hajime-san, runs a small record store that he is often absent from, instead roaming around Tokyo recording the sounds of trains. He also has a hobby for making surreal, train-inspired digital art. And that's pretty much the entire movie. Yet slowly, the zen-like peacefulness of the movie -- of Yoko and Hajime-san, content in their slight, yet deeply-meaningful pursuits, against the backdrop of Hou's rhythmic long takes, unparalleled framing (of cafes, traincars, train stations, houses, apartments, bustling streets, idyllic countryside), and smooth, minute, brushstroke-like camera movements -- simply overtook me about halfway through. This film certainly does right by Ozu, with its lovingly-sketched characters, observant, understated drama, and ample opportunities to hear the city breathe. To that last point in particular, the sounds are immensely textured, a gorgeous landscape of Jiang Wen-ye's impressionistic piano music, quiet cafe phone conversations, buzzing city traffic, and of course, the calming sounds of trains gliding towards their destinations. Steve McQueen put it so aptly when he said that this film "happens without you knowing". Like the characters that it centers upon, <em>Cafe Lumiere</em> seems so slight -- like if you blink, you'd miss it -- yet the more you care to stop and examine, you find yourself swept away by an unfathomable depth that lies beneath. A film as layered as the triple-decker train junction seen in its final shot. </p>

          <p>Bess, a simple-minded and goodhearted woman (played by Emma Watson) in a devoutly religious Scottish seaside town is devastated when the husband she's recently been wedded to is paralyzed in a workplace accident -- at her husband's request, she prostitutes herself out to other men in town. Interesting simply because it's so brutally subversive, and Katrin Carlidge's performance as Bess's sister-in-law is one of the best I've seen in a long time. A spiritually-infused, melodrama in the same vein as Dreyer's <em>Ordet</em>, albeit much, much more twisted in a very Lars-von-trier-type of way. But despite the at-times beautiful rich sepia visuals, the tight, jumpy camerawork (characterized by rapid cuts and quick pans), and a soundtrack injected with 70s glam rock, the film feels rather dreary and slow, sex-obsessed, and worse, like a bit of a sick joke, almost as if it's mocking Bess's mental illness. Overall, I have a bit of trouble seeing why this is von Trier's most acclaimed film -- his masterpiece is clearly <em>Dogville</em>, with <em>Melancholia</em>, <em>Europa</em> and <em>Nymphomaniac: Vol 1</em> not too far behind, but I suppose <em>Breaking the Waves</em> belongs somewhere in the murky middle between these and the tiring indulgent works <em>Antichrist</em> and <em>Nymphomaniac: Vol 2</em>. </p>

          <p>Sublime -- between the mostly natural lighting, digital aesthetic, and handheld camera, and the ethereal soundtrack featuring ambient songs from the titular fictional singer, as well as Debussy's Arabesque, it unfolds almost like an extended music video -- but an exceedingly dark film lurks beneath. Told in a non-linear manner, with the story paralleled by esoteric Lily Chou-Chou fan chat messages, and unafraid to take some meanders (such as an extended amount of time spend on an Okinawan vacation) it's initially a bit hard to follow, but over time, a devastating sketch emerges of two 14-year-old friends, both fans of the same singer, who drift apart, one (Hoshino) becoming the leader of a gang of bullies that terrorizes and rapes girls, the other (Yuichi), more introverted, aiding yet ambivalent of his former friend's sinister activities, delving deeper into Lily Chou-Chou fandom. This story unfolds against the backdrop of a toxic home and school environment, culminating in a shocking scenes, first in which Hosino and his gang rapes the shy, musicially-brilliant girl Kuno, and then in which Yuichi stabs Hoshino at a Lily Chou-Chou concert. In the end, however, there's no redemption or peace for either Kuno or Yuichi, just the music of Debussy and Lily Chou-Chou. Stylistically, its bright, light, free-flowing nature reminds me of Hong Sang-soo's <em>Right Now, Wrong Then</em>. Thematically, there's many shades of Edward Yang's <em>A Brighter Summer Day</em> here, as both are sprawling, yet intensely personal stories of troubled youth driven to commit shocking criminal acts, and the music that is the only source of comfort in their lives. While a bit dated (clearly there's an early 2000's vibe) and not quite as large in scope or formally brilliant as Yang's masterwork, this film definitely holds its own.</p>

          <p>Standout sequel to <em>Black God, White Devil</em>. Not quite as breathtaking as the first work, but a unique film of its own, blending the frenzied mysticism of the original and the unabashed political overtones of Rocha's other work <em>Terra em Transe</em>. The titular existentialist assassin makes a more than welcome return, as he experiences a change of heart after so many years as a hired-man for the powerful and corrupt. Here we see a tired man trying to atone for his past, who comes to accept the insignificance of his own redemption in the face of greater political movements. Few filmmakers have a language which is wholly their own -- David Lynch, Jacques Tati, Wong Kar-wai, Tsai Ming-liang come to mind -- but with his insurgent brand of high art, Rocha can definitely be counted among them. </p>

          <p>Simple, gritty, and haunting work. Frenetic editing, with a restlessly moving handheld camera for much of it. Truly inspired camerawork, at times documentary-like, with some strong acting to boot. The pallette of moody, saturated colors is a gorgeous homage to Wong Kar-wai. The enigmatic and intimate <em>Vertigo</em>-esque story unfolds inventively, told over many years as the main character Mardar crisscrosses paths with the unseen narrator during his far-flung search for the young girl from his past. A seedy, ultimately devastating tale of mistaken identity and two men fixated on their memories of love. I would not be surprised if Bi Gan took some inspiration from this film, both narratively and stylistally, in making <em>Long Day's Journey Into Night</em>. This is the work of a scrappy, talented artist, wholly passionate about his craft. </p>

          <p>I can't say that I understood it in the least, and my hopes for ever understanding it on a narrative level are slim. But for two-and-a-half hours of Lynchian madness -- it takes 20 minutes or so to get truly going -- look no further. Some of the most nightmarish imagery ever put on screen can be found here, a chilling odyssey of <em>Eraserhead</em>-esque shadowy hallways and peculiar rooms, sudden musical numbers, films within films, industrial whirs and whistles, deformed close-up shots of people's faces, anthropomorphic rabbits, comic non-sequitir dialogue, Polish gangsters, and scattered encores of dark Hollywood satire that was central to <em>Mulholland Drive</em>. Lynch is the only filmmaker I know who is able to create a work so utterly incomprehensible, yet leave me with the sense that some perfectly coherent explanation exists for it all. Yes, it's self-indulgent, yes, it's hopelessly obscure, but when you're invited into Lynch's personal world -- the film plays out like a home movie at times -- you don't refuse the offer. He could have simply stuck with the formula of <em>Lost Highway</em> and <em>Mulholland Drive</em>, but instead, he reached further in this sprawling, sometimes slow, often exhilarating trip down the (or rather, multiple) rabbit holes. At once a culmination of all the great artist's work, and a film that boldly pushes the boundaries his oeuvre, and all of cinema for that matter. </p>

          <p>Like <em>Goodbye, Dragon Inn</em>, this one also focuses on characters at the margins of society. His films admittedly require a very particular mindset to enjoy -- for the uninitiated, they appear tiresome, tedious, and miserable. But there's a peculiar magic to his ascetically gorgeous style -- those still shots that seem to linger on for several minutes too long, the gritty, decrepit buildings that form his landscapes (although many of the earlier scenes in this one are outdoors), the mundane, miniature movements of characters in isolation, with often unknown motivations and circumstances. His films lack music and are sparse on dialogue -- the only soundtrack in this one are the whirrs of cars and motorcycles, running water, and to incredible effect at the end, the progression of human breaths -- but it's not like either are missed, let alone needed. With each minutes-long take, he draws us into the world of his characters, gradually revelating their situations and relationships. Those long opening few shots seem to reveal a loose, scattershot web of characters -- it is only when we are considerably into the film that we finally piece together that they all are part of a family. Far from being tedious and glacial, each extra second the shot lingers gives us an extra second to soak in the fullness of his shots, to take a pulse of what the characters are thinking without hearing so much in words. We can so acutely feel the frustration and sorrow the father feels with his dead-end life -- that scene in which he mutilates a cabbage that his children have fashioned into a doll has to be one of the most remarkable in all of cinema. We sense the overwhelming love the mother feels for her son and daughter as she washes her daughter's hair at the supermarket where she works, and tracks both of them from a distance by night. We sense the hunger the daughter feels as she stares longily across the table at a businessman who is eagerly slurping his noodles. While the tragedy of the central family's situation is clear, we are still beckoned to see the world throught the innocent, playful eyes that the children, left to their own devices all day, do. Ultimately, we begin to feel a zen-like gravity, a deep appreciation for the serenity of the moment that Tsai is showing us, one that we would otherwise whizz right past in the frenzy of our day-to-day demands, whether it be the comings and goings of cars at a busy intersection, the barkings of stray dogs in an abandoned courtyard, or the striking, otherwordly walls of an apartment. A masterpiece from a master of the highest order.</p>

          <p>Was expecting a taut action film the first time I watched this one, and I was bitterly disappointed. Watching it a second time, I can confidently say that the main attraction here is Hou Hsiao-hsien's direction. Even in his late period, he is at the peak of his craft, with fluid, stroke-like camera movements, and painterly, saturated landscapes. This movie is plain beautiful to look at, and that alone makes it worth watching. Yet the film ultimately feels rather empty. While I appreciate the subtlety of the narrative and Hou's restraint in telling the story -- heck, it's almost like he's trying to tease the audience through repeatedly building up intrigue that culminates anti-climactically -- the characters feel wooden and underdeveloped. For instance, while I am a big fan of Shu Qi, by the end of the film, we realize that we don't know much about the titular assassin Yinniang at all, and for that matter, she hasn't changed much during the course of the story. Maybe the point is that she is stagnant and unchanging, but it's hard to get a read either way. While Hou's earlier films like <em>A Time to Live, A Time to Die</em> and <em>Milennium Mambo</em> felt so endearing and personal, this one feels excruciatingly beautiful, and nothing more. </p>

          <p>Delightful melodrama. Unfortunately the subtitles of the version I watched were so bad that I couldn't follow the particulars of the film quite well, but it's a rather simple plot. Set in a fishing region where women are expected to be virtuous in order to protect their menfolk from the turbulent sea, the daughter of a greedy fisherman is forbidden from marrying the man that she loves, and forced to marry another man. While she tries to remain committed in her marriage, vicious rumors swirl about her and that other man, eventually pushing her to her tragic breaking point. The seaside scenery is lovingly shot -- technically the film is very strong. The musical numbers are also all outstanding. Easy to see why it is considered such a classic of Mayalam cinema. </p>

          <p>Wong Kar-wai's tour-de-force, featuring many of the greatest Chinese actors of the generation (Tony Leung, Zhang Ziyi, Gong Li, Faye Wong, Chang Chen), in my mind the culmination of all of his prior works, one which carries a special, heartbreaking banner considering how little he's made since. <em>2046</em> is the most epic, luxuriating, self-indulgent dive into Wong-world, one brimming with stories and ideas, one which sometimes seems like it's about to collapse under its own weight. The same Mr. Chow from <em>In the Mood for Love</em>, the sadness of his neutered affair still heavy on his heart, returns to Hong Kong many years later as a pulp novel writer during a 3-year span of social unrest. Based out of a grimy hotel room 2047 he carries on a life of serial womanizing and partying, at times interacting with and at times longingly observing the lives of two women who rotate in and out of his lfie -- the hotel owner's daughter (played by Faye Wong), in a passionate yet forbidden relationship with a Japanese man, and a beautiful young prostitute played by Zhang Ziyi. Stuck in a hedonistic, sensual lifestyle, Mr. Chow is never able to forget his past, let alone able to find happiness for himself -- alas, the only fleeting moments of fulfillment he finds are through the lives of the characters played by Faye Wong and Zhang Wiyi, and his science-fiction writing, into which he projects the events of his life. While those around him advance through their youths and their passionate love affiars, Mr. Chow drowns himself in a sea of lost memories. This is the paradox of 2046 -- this futuristic landscape only drags him deeper and deeper into a reckoning with his past. As he sadly notes, "Love is all about timing. It's no good meeting the right person too soon or too late". Missed timings, missed opportunities, fleeting encounters, the indifferent, often cruel march of time is what drives <em>2046</em> forward. The futuristic scenes are dazzlingly-rendered, not so much meant to be convincing in the high-budget sense, but the playing field of Mr. Chow's consciousness. Wong Kar-wai's craftsmanship fires on all cylinders -- some of his finest cinematography and visual motifs lie here. What is so moving about repeated shots of a hotel billboard, and someone staring off into space from its adjacent balcony? Or a framed shot of a building hallway, from which a woman talks on the phone? Or of an android endlessly looking out the window of a moving train? Whatever it is, Wong Kar-wai's filmmaking, while admittedly showy, and sometimes lacking the substance of the works, of, say Hou Hsiao-hsien, is truly its own language, one that I claim not to fully understand, but marvel at wholeheartedly.</p>

          <p>Exhilarating yet melancholy, relentlessly progressive yet nostalgiac, warm yet at-times brutal; pulsingly peaceful. Takes some obvious cues from the work of Wong Kar-wai, in particular, <em>Chungking Express</em>, as a film set against the backdrop of Taipei's nightclubs -- bursts of primary colors, light, luminescent blues, deep pinkish reds, yellows, indie rock-sounding beats, a somewhat dual plot, atmospheric lights that portray a longing for a time long passed. A comparison to Wong Kar-wai's <em>In the Mood for Love</em> also came to mind while watching this movie. Like that one, this one too feels inextricably tied to the dawn of the new milennium from which it emerged (well, the title says so much). Wong's work is more classy and brooding, and great in its own way, but Hou's work is simultaneously filled with a loud, raw energy and the composed assurance only a great director at the peak of his powers can provide. The opening shot, is case in point -- in slow-motion, a young woman (the beautiful, extraordinary Shu Qi) walks across a brightly lit overpass at night, periodically looking over her shoulder, the camera glides alongisde the woman, panning up and down between the row of blue lights overhead and the woman's silhouette, as rock music plays, and the same woman from 10 years later begins to narrate her life. It is surely one of the most stirring I've seen, and arresting departure from the Hou films I've seen previously, which were mostly rigidly-composed historical dramas. There are still elements of those here -- while there is plenty of movement within the shots, the shots themselves perhaps run even longer than those in <em>The Puppetmaster</em> or <em>A Time of Live, a Time to Die</em> -- but this work in particular has a youthful dynamism while still retaining the emotional and narrative depth present in Hou's other films. For that, I am tempted to consider this his finest work, and hope to rewatch very soon. </p>

          <p>A sumptuous parody and homage to the sleuth stories of yore. It's entertaining to see Daniel Craig play a star detective with a thick Southern drawl, but perhaps more impressive, this movie manages to switch gears 4 or 5 times midway and mostly suceed. The movie goes from Clue/Sherlock Holmes-style mystery to family drama to high-speed thriller to political fable. But it's on this last count that Johnson's film proves to be rather clumsy, obviously trying to pander to the liberal Hollywood elite through the blameless immigrant heroine who by the story's end, displaces the previously-wealthy, white family. In this regard, the movie tries a bit to hard to be a movie of our times. Its breaking of detective genre conventions is to be admired, but I just wish that this film had found a way to come across as less overt and self-congratulatory in its tone.</p>

          <p>Charming, Chaplin-esque Tati comedy which pokes fun at vacationing bourgeoisie mannerisms, which Mr. Hulot tries in futility to adapt to. Largely bereft of dialogue and full of funny sounds -- loud, trumpeting music from Mr. Hulot's record player, the garbled echo of a train station speaker, the (accidental) blasting of fireworks at the end -- it plays out almost like a silent film. One has to admire the attention to detail in Tati's carefully coordinated slapstick routines. His movies are truly universal. However, Tati's comedy in this movie is slighter compared to Chaplin's or Keaton's, and it's maybe for this reason that I didn't find it as funny as I was expecting (perhaps I was just spoiled by his unceasingly brilliant Playtime). A fine showcase of Tati and the Mr. Hulot character, but not quite a masterpiece in my opinion. </p>

          <p>Quite ashamed that I haven't read <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em>, meaning that I missed the many references, but this film was still a delight to watch regardless. It's length (over 3 hours) is quite imposing, but unlike many shorter films, it never overstays its welcome. Rivette's movie is exceedingly playful, tinged with magic and fantasy, not in an utterly unbelieveable way, but in a strange and adventurous way -- long, lovingly-shot walks through the streets of Paris (including in that wondrous opening scene), variety shows in nightclubs, midnight heists of the library, and, of course, repeated trips to a mysterious house, where a story-within-a-story takes place. There are shades of Daisies here in the relationship and (naughty) deeds of the two main characters, and the influences this film had on <em>Mulholland Drive</em> -- switched identities, daytime trips to a house, magic performances, two female buddies out to crack a mystery -- are clear to see. Besides the main mystery, Rivette inserts other enjoyable footnotes -- a magic square on a chalkboard, Julie's trip to her grandmother's, Celine dressing up as Julie to reject Guilou. Doesn't quite crackle with the same energy and originality that Daisies did, and Rivette's work succeeds in being lighthearted more than actually comedic, but Celine and Julie form what has to be one of the most magnetic on-screen pairs (the fish Harold too). A high point of surrealistic film, to be sure. </p>
