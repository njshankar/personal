          <p> A rugged cowboy truck driver assembles a "dream team" to help the middle-aged widow Tampopo in her quest to turn her ramen shop into the best in town. As the synopsis suggests, the film made me very hungry, but there's not much else to dislike about it. It's endlessly charming with a likeable cast of characters (led by an immensely likeable protagonist in Tampopo) and crisp and colorful cinematography. There are a number of quirky, tangential side plots (all food-related) that feel like delighful side dishes in a great big feast. Itami's movie is Tarantino-esque without the gratuitous violence and desperate attempts to seem smart. But above all it's fun; it pulled me in from the very first, fourth-wall-breaking scene. I don't think I've been this dazzled by a film since Tati's <em>Playtime</em>. An indisputable classic of world cinema. </p>

          <p>After their girlfriends leave for a European vacation, two slobbering, sex-obsessed, hard-partying adolescent boys take a road trip to the beach with a middle-aged woman who is the cousin-in-law of one of the boys. I have trouble coming up with a movie that I would less want to watch with my parents, but threesomes and animalistic sex scenes aside, it's a very sweet and nostalgic story of friendship, and the characters, particularly Luisa, possess true depth. The project benefits from confident direction, as well as crisp, often-handheld cinematography that makes clever use of camera movement; with frequent narration, it unfolds like a short story put to film, a style that I found myself to enjoy very much. Cuaron's three-player affair also serves as a vehicle for highlighting the socioeconomic problems and political turmoil taking place in Mexico at the time, and effectively so. As the narrator, in a hushed and fiery tone, described things like election protests and a migrant worker killed crossing the street and a rural fisherman getting screwed over by the tourist developments, I couldn't help but be reminded of <em>Two or Three Things I Know About Her</em>. Except unlike that incredibly tedious work of Godard's, this one is actually enjoyable to watch. Great acting and wickedly sharp filmmaking.</p>

          <p>A wonderful example of storytelling on film. The very simple plot and gritty, unimpressive production are part of the charm, mirroring the protagonist's own lack of means. The school scenes are some of the most riveting I've seen in a while -- the soccer scene, the employment interview scene, the classroom storytelling scene. They form a startling contrast to Casper's beatific adventures with his bird, and effectively portray the larger societal forces that constrain the boy's future. Even the mean teachers, the uncaring mother, and the wicked brother Jud don't come across as villains, but cogs in an unfortunate machine. </p>

          <p>A tad sentimental for my taste, with a setup unapologetically contrived, but at the end of the day it's a sweet, snow-covered little story that benefits from smooth execution and likeable characters. The plot glides between the present and the high-school past in a graceful way. Nakayama, playing the two leading roles, is understated and endlessly charming; it's a shame she hasn't been in too many more movies. While I don't think <em>Love Letter</em> is quite as good as <em>Lily Chou-Chou</em> (which I consider among my favorite movies), I continue to be impressed by Iwai's beautiful cinematography and moving use of music. </p>

          <p>I don't know if I'm as high on this one as many others seem to be, but I certainly found it to be interesting. The film tells a different, character-driven kind of story than the ones typically portrayed in Hollywood, blending fact and fiction in a unique way. Zhao is a talented, uncompromising filmmaker; McDormand is a heck of an actress, and the rest of the cast, which seems to largely consist of unknown actors/non-actors, shines behind her, lending the movie admirable authenticity. </p>

          <p>It's everything a noir should be -- high-stakes situations, class, an irresistable femme fatale and slick leading man, sharp black-and-white cinematography, a tinge of the exotic. A few spellbinding Rita Hayworth musical numbers make the film truly iconic. Gilda may not be high art a-la Tarkovsky or Bergman, but it pushes all the right buttons and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's the cinematic equivalent of a highly-potent drug.  </p>

          <p>A ridiculously committed performance by Anthony Hopkins props up an otherwise dreary, mostly incomprehensible affair that reeks of typical prestige drama.

          <p>The first 30 minutes possess a beauty that transcends explanation. It may very well be the most powerful half hour I have seen in a movie. The rest of the movie unfolds at a glacial pace, but is redeemed by stunning cinematography (truly, I think, some of the best ever committed to film) and a stunning conclusion that possesses the same kind of transcendental power as the first 30 minutes. Kore-eda's debut feature film may border on being boring at times, but I admire a film with the boldness to stare the uknowable straight in the face, and the magical moments make it worth the watch. </p>

          <p>The first thing I realize after viewing this is how faithful Herzog's remake was. The next thing I realize is how this film is every bit deserving of its vaunted status in cinema. Even 100 years later, it still packs a punch. Featuring plague rats, carnivorous plants, bloodsuckers, expressionist setpieces, and hysteria, histronics, and paranoia of all varietes, Nosferatu breathes chaos. There's nothing remotely subtle about anything it does, but if the purpose of a film is to put on a memorable spectacle, Murnau's film wildly succeeds. </p>

          <p>Yes, the cinematography and soundtrack may be somewhat lazy, overly eager to lean into stereotypical portrayals of the countries the film spans -- mariachis and quinceaneras in Mexico, Arabic music playing over the uncivilized hills of Morocco, glitzy nightclubs in Tokyo. Yes, film, despite its evident ambition to weave together multiple storylines from multiple parts of the world, largely centers the American characters. And yes, the links between said multiple storylines from multiple parts of the world sometimes seem hasty and tangential. But pretensions aside, with its frenzied cinematography and rotating sceneries like channels on a TV, and wonderful performances from actors and actresses of many nations (particularly the Japanese girl Rinko Kikuchi, excluding Cate Blanchett), the film makes for a riveting viewing experience, and oddly enough, has continually wormed its way into my mind in the months since. </p>

          <p>Thematically, when considered with the other Ozu movies I've seen, it seems to be par for the course. But I can't that imagine many filmmakers can do the domestic drama genre better than Ozu, and this is one of his very best. One plot concerns an older couple whose marriage, arranged and loveless for so many years, finally appears to be crumbling, while another main plot concerns the twenty-something niece of the couple, who defies her mother and refuses to enter into an arranged marriage. The events themselves rather predictable, but as usual, it's the irresistably charming flourishes -- wholesome (and not-so-wholesome) intergenerational relationships, stately shots of Tokyo boulevards, the interiors of bustling pachinko parlors, bicycle races and baseball games, and, of course, the taste of green tea over rice -- as well as the earnest screenplay that carry the day. One quote I remember well is that of the uncle, who says that he prefers that things be "simple, down-to-earth, without celebration and affectation." This also seems like a fine encapsulation of Ozu's decidedly unflashy approach to filmmaking, and I can't help but be a sucker for it.</p>

          <p>Stone cold, soul-sucking thriller, masterful in its effectiveness. Reminds me of nothing less than an Edgar Allan Poe story in how it builds up so much dread and tension, particularly through the setting of an isolated country estate. With quietly haunting colors/imagery, captivating performances (the stepmother is alternately pitiful and terrifying, a brilliant enigma of a character), and assured direction, this film is nothing less than flawless for its first 90 minutes. Unfortunately, the last 20 minutes feel overly-cryptic and the revelations that unfold here don't feel entirely convincing or natural given the preceding events (although perhaps if I rewatch it things will make more sense), relying too much on supernatural phenomena and psychological gimmicks. That being said, the final flashback is powerful and emotionally devastating, and I definitely want to check out more of Kim Jee-woon's work!</p>

          <p>I can't say that I was too excited to watch this film, sensing similarities to <em>Equinox Flower</em> and <em>Late Spring</em> in its middle-class-aging-father-trying-to-marry-his-daughter type of plot. I know now that it's so much more -- I'm tempted to view <em>An Autumn Afternoon</em> as Ozu's finest effort. The man is incapable of making a bad film, and all his trademarks are here in full force -- the easygoing conversations between old friends, cozy interior shots of houses, offices, bars, unexpected moments of good-natured humor (faked wakes, marital rows over golf clubs), elegent orchestrals setting the stage for each new scene. What sets this particular effort apart, though, is how deftly it mixes different emotional colors; the subject matter of <em>An Autumn Afternoon</em> (a father realizing that he might be holding back his daughter's life by keeping her around to do chores) on one hand quite depressing, but the story unfolds with such grace and tenderness. In the end, we see the father's daughter forced into marriage, to someone who is essentially a stranger, leaving the father and her brother to live on their own -- this shouldn't feel like a happy conclusion, but I couldn't help but smiling as the credits began to roll. In that final kitchen shot of father and son, it seems like Ozu is trying to tell us that life goes on, and that no matter all will turn out OK. Watching this film makes me realize that great artists, filmmakers or otherwise, don't necessarily need to be highly varied in their styles, plots, or subject matters -- in a sense, it feels much more rewarding to go through the filmography of someone like Ozu, where the variations between films are often slight, subtle, and powerful to appreciate. </p>

          <p>There are certainly things to like about this film, not least the assured editing and cinematography that are trademarks of the immensely talented Park. The first half feels mostly like tablesetting, watching the gears of the titular character's revenge plot snap into motion, but it's an absolute delight to watch her calling in favors from old prison friends, wheeling and dealing her way to a job, an apartment, and the means to get back at the teacher who did her wrong. And of course, lady vengeance herself -- jaw-droppingly beautiful, multitalented, resourceful, driven to achieve her goal -- is an absolute gem of a character. The relationship between mother and daughter (who has been adopted by a family in Australia) is very sweet to watch, too. It's a shame, then, that the second half, in which a prolonged, communal revenge is taken on the child-killing teacher (he's not very convincing as a villain, nor well-developed as a characte), descends into contrived tedium. Perhaps Park is a bit too smart for his own good. </p>

          <p>Like Park's later film <em>The Handmaiden</em>, it's a cold slow-burner for much of its run before transitioning to a brutally violent last act. Park is a sly filmmaker with a wicked artistic sensibility, and while at times he perhaps puts style over substance, there's enough substance here to make this a success, whether it's the delightfully eccentric characterizations -- a mute protagonist who has a devotion to his sister, the protagonist's cocksure anarchist girlfriend, an electrical engineer turned CEO bent on revenge -- the ever-present theme of family, or the finely-tuned plot that features not just one, but multiple revenge storylines. </p>

          <p>Reminds me of Ozu's own <em>Late Spring</em>, another film (in color, this time) centered around marriage and the father-daughter relationship. The focus here is on the father Hirayama, a successful real estate businessman who aims to marry her daughter to a wealthy, well-respected young man. However, these hopes are jeopardized when it is revealed that his daughter intends to marry a co-worker at her chemical company. All in all, it's a well-crafted story of the clashes between the older generation and the free-spirited younger generation of women, who less desire respectability, stability, and tradition than happiness and true love. Probably goes on about 10 or 15 minutes too long, but until then, Ozu can do no wrong. I adore the free-flowing coziness of his films; nothing more than life unfolding onscreen. </p>

          <p>Endlessly charming effort from Ozu, filmed in rich, sharp color. In lieu of an overarching plot, there's 3 or 4 subplots, each with their own quirky comedies -- the dues for the town women's society have gone missing, two brothers vow not to speak to adults, an 20-something English teacher awkwardly pursues his crush, a hapless salesman goes from door to door, selling pencils. The story (or shall I say, stories) takes place against the backdrop of a modernizing, postwar Japanese society, and features a variety of interesting characters. Yoshiko Kuga, in particular, steals the show with her vibrant and bubbly performance as Setsuko. An elegant (which feels strange to say, given that the film film features recurring fart jokes), somewhat whimsical comedy which gives me vibes of Fellini's <em>Amarcord</em>. </p>

          <p>Wonderfully-acted tale of a Korean immigrant family living in rural Arkansas, in line with other Asian-American dramas set on the heartland, such as Andrew Ahn's <em>Driveways</em> or Kogonada's <em>Columbus</em>. Yet Minari shines brighter than those two, with its nuanced, richly drawn characters (the fun-loving, mischevious grandma, in particular), authentic dialogue and relationships, and tender storytelling. The film does an admirable job at not succubming to a "pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps" type of immigrant story, and not putting a focus on racism, discrimination, or the family's cultural experiences. Rather, we get to see the family at its core -- a flawed group of people who have shared many experiences, good and bad, together, with hopes for a better, more stable life that are far from guaranteed. Are the father's dreams of starting a farm the product of a hardworking man who is determined to secure a better life for his family, or man who is more obsessed with quixotic prospects of self achievement than the feelings of those around him? In the midst of the father's struggle, the son, long afflicted with a delicate heart condition, forms a close bond with his grandmother. I can't relate to every aspect of this family's life, but as an Asian midwesterner myself, I'm immensely grateful to see genuine stories like this told onscreen. </p>
