          <p> A rugged cowboy truck driver assembles a "dream team" to help the middle-aged widow Tampopo in her quest to turn her ramen shop into the best in town. As the synopsis suggests, the film made me very hungry, but there's not much else to dislike about it. It's endlessly charming with a likeable cast of characters (led by an immensely likeable protagonist in Tampopo) and crisp and colorful cinematography. There are a number of quirky, tangential side plots (all food-related) that feel like delighful side dishes in a great big feast. Itami's movie is Tarantino-esque without the gratuitous violence and desperate attempts to seem smart. But above all it's fun; it pulled me in from the very first, fourth-wall-breaking scene. I don't think I've been this dazzled by a film since Tati's <em>Playtime</em>. An indisputable classic of world cinema. </p>

          <p>After their girlfriends leave for a European vacation, two slobbering, sex-obsessed, hard-partying high school boys take a road trip to the beach with a middle-aged woman who is the cousin-in-law of one of the boys. I have trouble coming up with a movie that I would less want to watch with my parents, but threesomes and animalistic sex scenes aside, it's a very sweet and nostalgic story of friendship, and the characters, particularly Luisa, possess true depth. The project benefits from confident direction, as well as crisp, often-handheld cinematography that makes clever use of camera movement; with frequent narration, it unfolds like a short story put to film, a style that I found myself to enjoy very much. Cuaron's three-player affair also serves as a vehicle for highlighting the socioeconomic problems and political turmoil taking place in Mexico at the time, and effectively so. As the narrator, in a hushed and fiery tone, described things like election protests and a migrant worker killed crossing the street and a rural fisherman getting screwed over by the tourist developments, I couldn't help but be reminded of <em>Two or Three Things I Know About Her</em>. Except unlike that incredibly tedious work of Godard's, this one is actually enjoyable to watch. Great acting and wickedly sharp filmmaking.</p>
