      <h2>Notes on Taipei Story</h2>
      <p>Edward Yang, the late Taiwanese director, is best known for <em>A Brighter Summer Day</em> (1991) and <em>Yi Yi</em> (2000). Each sprawling, multi-faceted films that run in excess of three hours, these tend to overshadow some of Yang's other work. 1985's <em>Taipei Story</em> has a solid reputation of its own, as one of the first works of New Taiwanese Cinema to receive international attention, but with a runtime well below 180 minutes, it seems to sit a tier below Yang's subsequent twin masterworks in the minds of many. Or at least, perhaps it isn't as widely viewed (although one hopes that would change, given that it's available on Criterion Channel now!). Either way, consider this a much deserved <em>Taipei Story</em> appreciation post.</p>
      <p>Yang's sophomore effort centers on a couple living in, well, Taipei. Chin, a young sunglass-sporting woman with a lush mane of curly black hair, works as an assistant at an architecture firm. She is fiercely devoted to Lung (played by Yang's friend, and fellow giant of Taiwanese cinema Hou Hsiao-hsien), a well-built, middle-aged man who has just returned from the states, and may or may not have stopped over at Tokyo on the way back to visit a mistress. He takes pride in his youth baseball playing days, which he seems to be best known for among the friends and acquaintances among his generation, which include a local bartender and his aging former baseball coach Mr. Lai. His fabric trading business is floundering. </p>
