      <h2>Notes on Taipei Story</h2>
      <p>Edward Yang, the late Taiwanese director, is best known for <em>A Brighter Summer Day</em> (1991) and <em>Yi Yi</em> (2000). Each sprawling, multi-faceted films that run in excess of three hours, these tend to overshadow some of Yang's other work, including 1985's <em>Taipei Story</em>. While <em>Taipei Story</em> has a solid reputation of its own, as one of the first works of New Taiwanese Cinema to receive international attention, but it seems to sit a tier below Yang's subsequent twin masterworks in the minds of many. Or at least, perhaps it isn't as widely viewed (although one hopes that would change, given that it's available on Criterion Channel now!). Either way, consider this a much deserved <em>Taipei Story</em> appreciation post.</p>
      <p>Yang's sophomore effort centers on a couple living in the titular city. Chin, a young sunglass-sporting woman with a lush mane of curly black hair, works as an assistant at an architecture firm. She is fiercely devoted to Lung (played by Yang's friend, and fellow giant of Taiwanese cinema Hou Hsiao-hsien), a well-built, middle-aged man who has just returned from the states, and may or may not have stopped over at Tokyo on the way back to visit a mistress. He takes pride in his youth baseball playing days, which he seems to be best known for among the friends and acquaintances among his generation, which include a local bartender and his aging former baseball coach Mr. Lai. Newly reunited at film's start, Chin and Lung make plans to soon get married, and perhaps afterwards head back to the United States to assist Lung's brother-in-law with his prosperous import-export company.</p>  
      <p>It quickly becomes clear, however, that the situation is not so rosy for the couple. The architecture firm that Chin works at faces lawsuits for an accident at one of its buildings, and has been bought up by another firm, which means restructuring. Chin's erstwhile boss, the caring Ms. Mei, has left the company. Chin chooses to follow Ms. Mei out rather than face demotion. Meanwhile, Lung's fabric trading business is floundering. Additionally, after so much time apart, something has clearly altered in Chin and Lung's relationship, in no small part due to Lung's suspicious behavior in having a mistress. A strange distance has opened between them, a distance that gradually grows as the movie progresses.</p>
